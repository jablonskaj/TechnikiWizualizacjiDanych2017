healthy.
could be transverse myelitis swelling in the disk choking off nerve function.
it's a little weird to discuss the case while you're staring at your blood on the floor.
it's either that or a reflex response.
ok this is dr. house. house this is caren--
but she can't breathe if she's down.
she can't breathe--
that's not a pleural effusion.
could be an infectious process. tb?
you're thinking vascular tumor on her spine?
so what do you want us to do? start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?
yeah. drink.
aye aye. your arms and leg tissues are choked with blood. makes it hard to move. also damages your hair and toenails.
[holds up another cup when she's finished with the old one.] no vitamin c. now drink.
send him a note.
what'd he say?
2002 patient had dry eyes.
he had neurological issues.
dry eyes could indicate an autonomic dysfunction; goes on the board.
i'm happy we're doing this i'd much rather do this than lengthen some guy's tendon. patient's headaches increased. doc scanned his head found a tumor.
i'm learning.
cameron you are an excellent doctor you'll get lots of tearful thank yous from grateful patients.
no it's not a bad thing but it's not why i'm here. i took this fellowship to learn from house.
in 8 years the patient experienced 214 symptoms many of them repeating.
or a urinary tract infection.
if you add pain into the mix fever frequent urination could indicate a kidney problem.
his throat will collapse muscle degeneration in his neck won't tolerate the scope it's an automatic trach!
looks clean.
get it out get it out!
vitals all over the place. we're losing him.
it was clean.
you stick something down someone's throat they gag spasm which he did. it took us a half an hour to get that thing out.
there are no lesions on his brain nothing to interrupt the new orders.
you have no evidence of any wires down.
he will bleed into his brain!
chase go slow.
contrast material entering into the fourth ventricle. no parenchymal bleeds.
meninges are intact no bleeding.
we did a dangerous test and something bad happened that's all this is.
5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--
it's a regrowth benign.
no.
you are 0 for 1 since you came back. you just want to make sure <U+0096>
er ran a rape kit found no evidence of tearing semen or pubic hairs.
there is new research indicating a link between neurological problems and bleeding disorders.
what part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?
upper and lower endoscopies were clean.
maybe you were abducted; lost time.
kid's got a bleeding disorder.
had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.
big hand points to minutes. maybe you got them mixed up?
body attacks any foreign object. inflammatory reaction could have eroded into a vein fragment gets a free ride.
he clotted on his own?
this test is different. we'll draw some blood and see if any clotting factors are low or missing.
or two of them. [they look at each other.]
it is a bleeding disorder. clancy tested positive for von willenbrand's.
it's clean his heart isn't the problem.
let me ring up one of the homies.
you're wrong house.
where?
we already did. and once more after that.
there are ways dna could become mutated. extreme uv radiation.
we could search his home for toxins fungals and radiation.
well we got lucky with the heart. myocytes contract we can see that these weren't working. i don't know how the hell we're going to find it anywhere else.
you think house has lost his step?
cause i don't need to subject myself to house's torture if there's no upside.
you said the last case really threw him and now suddenly<U+0096>
so you changed your mind? why? his brilliant ideas in this case have all been yours.
you don't change your mind without a reason. what do you know?
the hallucinations and seizures indicate problems in the temporal lobe. sorry house it is neurological. looks like you're wrong again.
his symptoms are neurological; his condition has to be neurological!
he had a convulsion.
we've been through this.
of course the aliens didn't just visit him they replaced him.
you're in motor function. try two centimeters back.
you're in sensory getting closer.
we've got something.
brain waves indicate mild hallucination. neurons lighting up.
area's too fuzzy. hallucination isn't strong enough.
area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.
so the the pain's returned.
the ezra powell???
or his lungs; probably from using and inhaling toxic chemicals in his lab. [camera focuses on house grimacing in pain.]
so's his ekg it's not his heart.
so much for the admiration.
his heart rate's flat. we don't get it past 130 we're not gonna see anything.
his heartbeat's only 90. i'm gonna increase the incline.
still no sign of blockage.
so what do we do? we put a plastic bag over his head and get it over with?
sticking a metal syringe into a plastic i.v. line and pumping in a lethal dose of morphine is not letting nature take its course. not according to the state of new jersey.
whose side are you on senator? first respect his wishes then invade iraq then get the troops home. make up your mind.
you cannot help him kill himself.
all of that in 24 hours?
don't have the results.
no bacteria in the blood cultures. we still have some cooking but so far nothing.
where you going?
i can't let you do this. [he walks over to house who is filling the syringe to stop him.]
no it's about whether you die or we murder you.
or lupus.
ascending colon's clean.
sure could use a little more help around here.
yeah. if she was acting on principle she'd be in here trying to stop us. all she's doing is running away from the principle so she won't have to feel uncomfortable facing it.
[ignoring chase.] better hurry up.
i don't think she's gonna have a problem deciding what to tell cuddy. [ezra's heart monitor starts beeping.] o2 sats 89 and dropping.
the ivig made him worse. o2 stats plummeted.
so now we're going to operate on the guy?
heart rate's fast.
bp's stabilizing. [house sews up ezra to hold the tube in place. while doing this he accidentally hits his right hand. there is no reaction from ezra. again house prods - purposefully this time - and there is still no response. house goes to test ezra's left foot.]
those are just reflex arcs; he's under anesthesia.
we can't do that while he's in a coma.
all that tests is the brainstem.
i just said we can't do that while he's in a coma.
[curious.] what are you trying to prove?
ok so you got me curious.
that means the clean mri of his brain means it's just affecting the peripheral nerves.
or lymphoma.
sure we'll just wait until he leaves his room without his skin sneak in and take a piece. [chase snickers.]
there's no reason for it to be on the list.
we rejected amyloidosis because it didn't fit the first symptom we found. it would affect his heart.
how the hell you pull that out of --
he's autistic severely autistic. can't talk can't make eye contact. screaming's probably his way of communicating.
wow so clearly that can't be the answer. his brain can't filter information it's a constant assault on his senses i'd scream too.
so they're overprotective and scared that's all the more reason to--
er checked his throat no obstructions nothing! which means the only symptom was a scream which is diagnostic of nothing.
er said the heart was fine.
i had a date last night she screamed. should we spend a 100000 dollars testing her?
that's not what i'm saying!
we only have the scanner for the next half hour after that--
the sooner we do this test the sooner we can get you guys home.
if he has a vascular disorder we might not have--
i don't have 10 minutes. [he tries to snatch the psp from adam. beta comment: he obviously slept through class the day they discussed autism.]
could if i didn't want the test results to mean anything.
the ventilation scan was normal time to send him home.
a rhinovirus? you can't leave because she has a cold?
all the tests are normal.
which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.
parents have the smear the kit but the kid is constipated.
we need a stool sample. we should probably wait until he's finished playing that level huh?
[all pompous and i-told-you-so.] it is possible that he was never sick.
i took the stool sample after his lungs failed.
adam i need you to stay still buddy!
no.
echo suggested a conduction abnormality ekg confirmed it.
microbiology showed no organisms in the fluid so forget infection.
stool sample's negative.
it took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!
hey you got a minute?
we have a 10-yr-old with pleural effusion and conduction abnormality but no heart failure.
yeah that's why we're thinking cancer non-hodgkin's probably so we want to do a lung biopsy.
that's probably something an oncologist should do right?
still just to be safe you mind? [wilson shakes his head.]
lymph system circulates fluid not organ cells.
liver isn't damaged. the tests were normal.
house when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver there was no scarring.
so you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.
they're doing it now.
like a biopsy; needles cells screaming.
you were too busy bothering cuddy as discussed it was negative for parasites. can we get out of here?
stool. and traces of iron zinc calcium carbonate can we leave?
his liver's damaged pleural effusion compromises lung function.
so he ate some chalk it isn't toxic sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.
jimson weed. found a small patch of it in his backyard. jimson weed contains atropine. poor man's acid. our kid's been tripping on lucy in the sky with cubic zirconium; explains the pleural effusion the heart arrhythmias.
done.
serum from the lab in patterson is 3 days minimum.
his schedule has nothing to do with jimson weed.
it's a tumor.
it's a micro tumor. started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. and then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.
i've a better chance of finding it now that i know exactly where to look. so unless you have a better idea i'm going to go ct his head and then if i have to remove his eye.
some emergency bumped him; we've got another room in 10 minutes.
what are you looking for?
stool samples were negative for parasites.
cameron tested the sand.
i'm guessing people in love?
clearly he did and wilson denied it and house doesn't believe him. it's gotta hurt that's why it pays to have more than one friend house.
didn't need to touch her some guy coughed on her right?
at a stretch she'd have a fever.
sorry take it back that's a stretch.
salmonella's a bacterial infection that you can get from pot plants causes stomach pain.
the thinking is it's an inflammatory reaction to the smoking.
most cases a lot.
let's just start the treatment.
actually i'm wondering if you'd mind getting her a cup of ice chips.
tracy i need to talk to you.
i need to know your answers aren't being pressured. [jeremy looks annoyed]
okay. [hangs up the drip] worse case scenario it'll help us rule out a few things.
allergic reaction to the floroquinolone.
man why does that sound so familiar? you think it's 'coz i said it an hour ago?
exercise-based anaphylaxis? think that requires exercise. when her throat closed they'd just got done eating not even competitive eating.
better yet put a gun to her head threaten to rape her.
no.
i'm not betting on a patient's--
tracy i'm increasing the speed a little.
we're not getting any allergic response yet.
we don't complete the test my boss will just come down here and do it himself; you do not want that.
i don't want to have to ask you leave.
where?
[picking up the phone] it's foreman: get me a wheelchair!
he's as sick as she is now.
it worked on the wrong patient.
we didn't bet!
[pays up as they enter the locker room] husband's test showed no mi. no aortic dissection. it's not his heart it's just nonspecific chest and abdominal pain.
house you wanna mess with wilson no problem. but you've got no reason to screw around with <U+0096>
okay. why assume one disease? his chest her throat.
it means you're insane! wilson's not dating her.
it doesn't matter what i answer?
she's literate.
then how come it's taking you so long to search it?
i know you're poor now but buy your own.
no no put that back.
we show that to house he'll just call the guy a cheating bastard. look how he is with wilson!
one that doesn't give him any symptoms in his sexual organs? he never mentioned anything.
maybe the wife just wants to be extra cautious?
yeah.
he loves her!
people lie i get it but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless <U+0096>
sorry! ridiculous of me to draw a conclusion based on actually observing them. i should have just depended on your misanthropic view of human nature.
so you just wanted to be extra cautious.
please don't say it.
we're still gonna test ya.
yeah that's it.
great. prove us all wrong.
no scarring no purulent discharge and the nats were negative. they don't have an std.
thank you chase.
not sure i understand your ghetto slang dr. house. how many black women have you dated by the way?
yeah my exes have usually been black so what? it's not a racial thing it's cultural. i have more in common with them like i assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.
the abdominal pain's getting worse. we've had to up their morphine twice.
what happened?
no one's hurting him.
it was an acute delirium.
well she's not really talking. she's just making sounds.
jeremy she's in a coma.
so her vitals are pretty stable but her response to stimuli is getting weaker which means the coma's getting worse. the brain is slowly shutting down.
we're getting more images to check for masses or infection. [jeremy groans.] i'll increase your morphine.
not usually. in some cases the form of the hallucination can tell us what part of the brain is being hit.
your dad was breaking your arm?
you still in touch with him?
hmm. it's not medical i just thought blacks were the racist ones.
or tumors or anything.
didn't spike a fever when we took her off the steroids so it's not an infection.
what if they didn't both get it? maybe we got our basic assumption wrong and it's two different diseases?
sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.
i did see these two putting out that blaze in the pine barrens.
and if you're wrong?
he never said that.
uh no.
an opiate blocker? it'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire. that's pretty unethical even for you.
you're not doing it either. what you're gonna run for it?
damn it! [he runs off throwing the tube to chase.]
no it won't. the morphine just isn't working right now for some reason. i'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the mean time. it'll work again soon.
give up. or we can wait for him to grow up and get all cynical.
jeremy's worse.
it's not his brain. lactic acid's up to 39 his intestines are rotting.
or like i said before it might not be environmental or infectious. he has vasculitis she has porphyria. belly pain plus hallucinations classic symptoms. can even cause a coma.
the bowel's not dead.
the bowel's not dead. just general swelling and edema. the high lactate was probably from stress. we just sliced him open from chest to pubic bone for nothing.
he wasn't cheating on her.
she's his only girlfriend ever. they grew up next door. they ran off together as teenagers. sarcoidosis. we only ruled it out because we thought he had isochemic <U+0096>
they were trying to escape his evil pill-popping racist dad. you would have liked him. we should do another biopsy.
he beat up his son for dating a black girl. extrapolated from that <U+0096>
you're not saying they're not brother and sister?
you won't know for sure <U+0096>
her response to stimuli is still just as weak.
it's just her oximeter.
we've obviously got to let them know what's wrong but the cause the brother-sister thing
yesterday he was willing to die to save her. you've got to give him time to recover <U+0096>
unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union the chances of serious complications are minimal.
twice a day. angioedema's very treatable you'll be fine.
no it's a condition you both always had. the onset of symptoms are sometimes caused by stress or trauma <U+0096> the incident at the diner.
it's um it's a genetic disease. it's uh there's no good reason two unrelated people would get it. we think you guys should take a dna test.
we think you have the same dad. but we don't know for sure until we do the tests.
you're not really siblings.
you didn't fight in the back seat on car trips you didn't change each others' diapers you just met and fell in love. the way you feel that hasn't changed.
we just destroyed two peoples' lives.
i'd like to see some sign that it affects you or that you recognize that it affects other people.
sorry can't.
i'm busy.
i'm going out of town.
we can spend all day arguing whether you can bet when you know the answer beforehand. give me the two hundred bucks.
hey.
i was just wondering you really like jazz?
you lying?
no.
well they gotta find out sometime. [he stops her by tracy and jeremy's room.] let me just meet you at your place. [he goes in.]
she just needs some time alone. you want me to hang out here a bit? [jeremy nods tearfully.]
sure there wasn't a mix up with the lab?
there's nothing abnormal in the eeg or the neurological example.
if he was at the track he'd tell us so we don't have to page him and if it was a puffer fish he'd be dead in 6 to 8 hours tops. he's been in a coma for at least 24.
that explains the coma but how'd he get back in bed? ahhh! cameron's talking about house!
but i have seen how many pills he's been popping lately i wouldn't be surprised if he's in a coma somewhere himself.
co2 and oxygen stats are normal.
it's hard to believe you can even attach this much flesh to a human skeleton.
what are we supposed to do? refuse treatment to anyone who's obese?
well people who attempt suicide get treated.
what is your problem? you get beat up by a gang of fat kids when you were in grade school or something?
cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?
it's not pickwick's. intubation and steroids have had no effect. except maybe to cause whatever it is to get worse; he's got a fever now.
weight limit on the mri machine is 450 pounds.
limit's 350.
we give him blood thinners and the coma's caused by a bleed instead of a clot we'd kill him.
there's no way.
we get him on the table we break the table. we break the table hospital's out of a million dollars and we're out of our jobs.
and you believe the machine will stand on principle?
no midline shifts no bleeds clots infarcts.
calm down man calm down! get him out already!
or why he woke up.
what if it is hormones?
i'm talking about george. acute adrenal insufficiency could cause a temporary coma.
maybe the fever's not related.
we should do an acth stimulation test and check his skin for acanthosis nigricans.
acanthosis nigricans is a hyper-pigmentation of the skin usually indicates some sort of hormonal imbalance.
you having any problems with your vision?
a coma's not like a stomach ache; you can't just shrug it off and hope it's not anything serious.
there are over 400000 deaths caused by obesity-related illnesses.
george you ever notice you don't see a lot of obese old men?
skin exam and acth stimulation test were both normal. he has nystagmus but it's congenital; no way it's related to the coma. [he hands house a sheet of the results.]
not for long he wants to be discharged.
yeah i did.
disorientation and loss of balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.
kept saying it was pickwick's.
why? the disorientation and loss of balance are more recent.
but he's not in a coma anymore and he is disoriented.
you don't know that.
how could you possibly know--
but you were ok with him crashing through a glass wall?
so what do we do now?
how are we going to do that? he's too big to do an lp.
suction.
aspirator. [hands the sample to cameron.] your turn. irrigation. sponge.
nothing why what's wrong?
vision's blurry or you've lost it?
there's no inflammation in the optic nerve and his retina's intact. the blindness has to have been caused by something in his brain.
i took the sample from the pre-frontal i was never anywhere near his visual cortex.
not a chance the mri was clean.
where are you going?
it could be ms; it'd explain the coma the blindness loss of balance and the fever.
we already have a csf sample; we might as well check it for proteins and rule out ms first.
you're right about ms no myelin basic proteins in his csf.
what's going on?
err... you don't think he'll realize we're lying?
i meant about him having lung cancer.
[shrugs.] i noticed they were fat?
or brain tumor.
how did you jump to genetics? [coming over to look at the papers.] from his eeg? all you got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.
small seizures aren't unheard of in a patient in a vegetative state.
not an inherited condition.
[snorts.] they still make single beds?
house asked you to check out the home for toxins.
adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.
you said no one's been sick but what about delivery people repair guy?
what is it?
need a central iv! two units of packed red blood cells type o-negative!
may be academic i just started him on dialysis.
or neurological or...
l-dopa?!
the amount of amphetamines alone will be dangerous. besides whatever the hell else you got in there.
[amused.] a day or in a mouthful?
then no it is. cops have a thousand ways to make life difficult for you.
stopped all drugs except the antibiotics. his liver's just managing to hang in there.
why?
you believe it?
why absolutely. i do. i'm just checking how naive you are.
until his best friend says no to him. house is a junkie. junkies do whatever they have to do to get what they need.
chase isn't here. i'll start the...
the lab.
o2 sats down to 70.
point-three milligrams of epi. in.
check the pulse.
it's not his liver.
it's the heart.
patient's bp just dropped like a stone.
it didn't. mercury test was negative.
[sighs and ignores the question.] house is an ass. but he obviously needs pain medication. how much pain one person feels is not a call the government should be making.
[pretends to think about it.] yeah. i do.
you're not qualified to make...
[from phone.] foreman.
it's not gonna...
house. the kid has severe cardiomyopathy. alcoholic and no shot of a transplant. so yeah maybe you figured out why. good for you but he's gonna die anyway.
heart attack. his cath was clean and echo showed no functional abnormalities.
kid's been hanging over a toilet despite anti-emetic therapy. persistent vomiting could indicate increased intra-cranial pressure tumour...
[deadpan] right. it's the feet. if only i was a podiatrist.
this isn't a game house.
[testily] what are you writing?
he's eighteen. probably drinks smokes does drugs. how close am i?
i am doing an mri.
same thing with the stress test.
seriously you're playing his game?
[singsong] i'm not playing. [into microphone] keep very still jack. this won't take long.
[into mic] no. ignore him. [to house] 's not his lungs.
jack he asked you a question.
he's still puking and he had a heart attack aaand... itchy feet! it's not his lungs.
hep-a doesn't explain the heart attack.
[brightly] 'morning!
good news. we can take you off the ivig. the hep-a has cleared your system. you'll be good to go by tomorrow.
could have been contaminated food. could have been from cleaning the bathrooms at work. or it could've been...
[leaning closer to jack whispering] analingus is a common way.
you should just tell the people that you've dated that they should get themselves checked.
raise your arm above your head!
[vo] high pt and ptt in jack's blood panel confirm a coagulopathy.
he's not miserable.
[skeptically] jack's the only one who got sick?
kid's got tattoos piercings and probably some nasty little girl loaned him the hep-a. could've also given him syphilis or gonorrhea.
gonna get a sample of your brother's spinal fluid. where's will?
it's gonna help us figure out what's making him sick. shouldn't you be in class too?
[always the skeptic] for you but not will?
[thinks] well i guess it's quicker than calling a nurse... and a truant officer. 'kay grab his shins push his knees up towards his chest.
now hold them there tight.
[chuckles] my boss doesn't trust them to do anything else.
no. no one's gonna die.
[chuckles] i meant...
we're nowhere near anything like that happening right now.
okay?
let's get him back over.
i barely touched him.
[without hesitation] no. i did a needle aspiration to confirm whether...
he's got osteomyelitis. means you're wrong about food-borne toxins.
aaaand... [to cameron] you can stop too. it's syphilis.
[holding out the paper] read the printout.
no.
it's okay to have three?
[vo] we managed to clear all three infections out of his system but now he's having seizures every few
nothing. there were no structural abnormalities on the ct. non-focal neuro exam. no electrolyte imbalance. nothing.
you're thinking trauma?
's no way to know. it's impossible to test fat cells for drugs.
[too steamed to talk] drugs stay in your system a long time.
what do you tell him?
house! bad news.
jack seized again. but his blood was clean completely drug-free.
it's not a coincidence. he's still seizing every four hours whether we stick him in a sauna or not.
[to elderly guy] he's a doctor. [gives him a thumbs-up]
i'm sure not for long.
we scanned him.
seizures usually indicate something neurological.
we'll know more after the test.
let's not get ahead of ourselves okay? you'll be home yelling at 'em and kicking their butts before you know it.
this kid might be facing a terminal disease and he's more worried about his brother and sister.
[looking at chase's monitor] what's that? frontal lobe upper right quadrant.
[pointing to a white spot] there. it's tiny but... think it's a tumour.
[sighs ominously] they're everywhere.
jack's brain is riddled with tumours. and you know what he's doing?
setting up playdates.
house you're pathetic. you analyse anyone's faults hypocrisies weaknesses. but this kid's got some strength and all of a sudden there's no time to talk about anything but the medicine.
[frustrated] and save his life! i know the notion of self-sacrifice is foreign to you...
if you're wrong about the fungus you're wasting what little time he has left.
they were abscesses from a fungal infection. aspergillis. but we still have no idea why.
points to complement deficiency.
little late to be playing games with us.
[vo] will's a match.
it's just a blood draw. there's no danger.
the risk for will? 's next to nothing.
you're immune-system can't fight off the germs we all come into contact with everyday. now that we know we can use more targeted medications. but you'll still get sick all the time. you'll be in and out of hospitals...
jack your life-span will be substantially shortened. and you'll be too sick to care for your brother and sister anymore.
there's no pressure.
he wants to help you.
he'll be fine. but you... [sighs] you're gonna have a hard time protecting him like this if you're dead.
[shaking his head] noble.
why can't you accept he wants to protect his brother?
[shakes his head] you're a hypocrite. [smirks wrily exaggeratedly imitating house] evidence is everything. truth is all that matters. [now himself] except when it comes to people. everything we've learned about this kid says you're wrong [playing with fuzzball] but you can't accept that. it's easy to reject the diagnosis. not so easy to reject your misanthropy. because then you'd have to give people a fighting chance. and that... scares the crap out of you.
jack your brother and sister need you.
i'm sorry.
you're a good kid. three months from now [shrugs] six months from now you'll be visiting them and you won't be able to say goodbye. you're gonna know you screwed up. you'll take his bone marrow and you'll take 'em back. [sighs] they'll be a burden and a pain and your life will never be what it was supposed to be.but you'll be proud of yourself. your parents [nods] gonna be proud of you.
[sighs then smirks and shrugs] it's what i wanna believe.
[still sitting] what's that density there?
[almost admiringly] you stash your drugs in a lupus textbook.
she's six. six-year-olds don't get gallstones.
[to chase] you might wanna wait until he actually tells us his theory before you start kissing his theory's ass.
it just looked that way from our angle. you on your knees house bending over.
i told you just his nature. poor guy's hardwired to kiss ass.
got a page.
any minute now.
sure.
guys!
[cell to his ear irritated] tritter froze my account. they're checking theirs. i'm on hold with the lawyer.
[shouting] you gotta talk to tritter! you gotta make this go away!
[still pissed] bacterial infections don't cause a vesicular rash. and doing nothing is not a plan it's specifically a lack of a plan!
[had enough of her whining] almost done here.
[raising an eyebrow] you see positive allergy tests and decide it's an infection?
it's diagnostically ridiculous.
chase you're right. the shape indicates allergy the tests indicate allergy. just because she's not allergic to peanuts doesn't mean she's not allergic to lidocaine or...
[cool] you really hope noone dies while i'm sitting here and not talking to you?
if i went out for coffee will i get back before you make your point?
[beat] my brother and i we grew up in the same home. but i made something of myself. he didn't.
much better as of about two hours ago. got any money for lunch?
[suspiciously] really?
i figured if he was singling you out you must have done something different.
yeah. and now that he's frozen your accounts you probably will. you need the cash right?
she's fine. she's resting.
[preparing a syringe] muscle rigidity is almost exclusively neurological.
no no corneal rings no mental changes.
i say we draw straws. loser drives out to trenton scores him an eight-ball.
[smiling] so far so good. just like five minutes ago ten minutes before that.
it's from a clot.
found it.
in a sec.
almost there.
that's out. ice packs aren't going to hold it for long. where are the blankets?
[quietly urgently] we need to cool this kid down before her brain melts.
what're you doing?
[persisting] he released our money. you do know what that means?
neither did i.
it worked.
_we_ weren't laughing with him.
chloramphenicol isn't working.
necrotizing fasciitis?
you're talking about crippling her.
he's yelled at us before.
he's going through withdrawal. could be causing mild paranoia. it'll pass we just have to suffer through it.
we gave her drugs. she had no negative reaction.
[shielding his eyes] get that thing away from me! i don't wanna get burned.
skin no. retina yes.
wilson told us he ratted.
it's appropriate he betrayed you. and you should take the deal.
could be lung cancer. tumour causes structural damage lung caves in on itself also explains the anaemia.
there's no liver problem.
you saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off? you just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with wilson.
cutting house off? might not work but it's not wrong.
[into the mic] abigail we need you to hold still ok?
just hang in there 2 more minutes and we'll be done.
cuddy's bending the rules to get a patient to do the right thing - who'd work for a doctor like that?
abigail are you ok? [she doesn't reply and continues to cough. the team see her crawl out of the mri and cough out blood they rush to attend her]
house was right her liver's failing.
schistosomiasis parasite could--
could be hepatitis budd-chiari--
i'll do a liver biopsy to confirm.
where's cuddy?
[checks outside in the clinic before walking in] you were right about the liver failure patient had variceal bleeding which suggested cirrhosis.
you predicted this you obviously saw something.
liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis but it shows sclerosing cholangitis. [he puts the sheet of paper of the results down on the table in front of house. house takes a glance then ignores it] even weirder there's no increase in alkaline phosphotates.
i take it that's where cuddy's been keeping your pills.
if that were true more than her lungs and liver would be affected. [he notices house looking at drawer and jerks his head to indicate house should be helping him to keep a watch out for cuddy]
i get why you don't want to go to rehab but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.
sorry.
home remedy for ear infections.
it certainly wouldn't indicate a pancreatic problem.
i did.
i think it will be i think we need to forget about the liver.
we need to stop retracing our steps and get ahead of this thing.
you don't think i could have come up with this?
you suspended house because it'd be dangerous having him in charge but getting his opinion--
just because house wants his pills doesn't mean his theory is wrong.
just because it wasn't alpha-1 doesn't mean the pancreas isn't next.
no.
don't worry you'll be sedated.
but we always want to respect the patient's wishes and not shove things down their throats.
no. abigail? [he checks her pupils] abigail? she's unconscious.
airway's clear. her breath smells fruity.
[to the nurses] hang an insulin drip at .1 migs (milligrams) per kig (kilogram) per hour. [then to wilson] pancreas is failing you ready to call house yet?
histiocytosis usually starts in the brain then moves to the internal organs. abigail's brain is fine. cystic fibrosis.
head ct was clean means it's not a neurological problem.
all we're doing is bouncing back and forth between cancer and autoimmune. we're going in circles.
yeah you could argue it violated doctor-patient confidentiality.
a hypothalamic tumour can cause vacillating temperatures.
he's seeing blue [house still in elevator pops a pill] where'd you get the script from?
heavy metal poisoning could cause vision changes particularly thallium.
he's 28 years old.
[following house cue another walk and talk] male menopause doesn't explain the vision.
burns to his genitals could cause testicular trauma.
it's nothing to be ashamed of once these testosterone pills dissolve your system will be back to normal.
derek you in pain?
[getting something out of a drawer] looks like an allergic reaction.
2mg of iv lorazepam stat!
it wasn't the medicine. contamination and allergy tests both came back negative.
aggression comes on that fast it's gotta have a neurologic basis. we should do a ct for frontal lobe tumour and an lp for meningitis.
to do what?
brain lesions would've shown up on the ct. legionnaires explains the chills and temperature; altered mental status causes the aggression.
we need to deal with this ourselves.
right now house has more important things to deal with.
or he doesn't feel pain.
no fluid in his lungs.
won't stay that way his blood test showed troponins and ck-mb up. chase was right he was hiding chest pain he's been having a whole series of heart attacks.
lack of oxygen to the brain causes disorientation increased adrenalin causes rage.
where you going?
fire water smoke oxygen masks.
thought that only happened to 80-year-old widows.
i already put him on beta-blockers and nitroglycerin no effect.
only other option is blood thinners.
chase's idea is as good as any i mean short of frying his brain and wiping amy out we're screwed.
why?
go.
heart sounds good.
going to give him his last round in the morning then be at court for your hearing.
we did an mri [goes back to house watching tritter on the stand] there's some slight hypoperfusion in the anterior cortex.
there's no hyper-intensity to suggest a foreign body near the region and no signs of infection or vascular malformation.
are you out of your mind?
you think the arteries are narrowing; you're going to need still shots which we can do without you.
injecting the dye. blood's in the capillaries.
[vo] he's sedated. it took five cc's of haliperidol to get him down after the paralytic wore off.
acoustic neuroma that started a haemorrhage.
if it explains everything what...?
he has a cockroach in his ear?
god knows why.
she wants to talk about the weather talk about the weather. she wants normalcy. she wants to feel like the world didn't end.
you might not wanna phrase it quite that way.
no he doesn't.
wrong! pretending this didn't happen is the best thing she could possibly do.
you know what we should be trying to make real or process? the few decent moments in our lives not the crap.
tell her your life sucked.
tell her anyway. she wants to know she's not alone. she wants to know she's gonna survive this thing. other people have been through this and worse and come out the other end. she wants to know she's going to heal.
act like... you've healed.
sixteen year old. respiratory arrest.
yeah me too. no sign of trauma. no history of asthma or allerg
no idea. stevie lippa his ekg and echocardiogram were normal.
sixteen year old kid. er workup revealed a bloody pleural effusion.
yeah. that occurred to me.
no tumors or pneumonia on the ct.
tox screen was clean.
if he popped an aneurysm he'd be in the morgue not the er.
there's still no answer at either one of your parents' cell numbers. is there any other way we might be able to contact them?
we need them to sign this.
still not an adult.
i can't.
you win. we're doing the venogram now. we'll deal with the fallout later.
that's just the dye. your nerves can't tell the difference between the cold inside your body and the wet outside your body.
a little of both. you like science? (pulls the screen closer with his foot. stevie looks at it.)
that's because it's the venous side. low pressure.
you taking physics already?
had to teach myself a lot of stuff too. school sucked where i grew up. you go to public or private?
yup.
no.
you gave us some numbers. we haven't been able to reach anyone.
well right now you're making you more vulnerable by lying to us.
all we're going to do is look around.
what else are you lying about? is your father really a professor?
they. so you're with your dad while he's making these deals.
you fly?
venogram's negative. no leak.
there's no leak. i even checked lymphatics.
we've ruled out toxins and drugs.
it's a deep vein thrombosis. the kid spent 16 hours in the back seat of an old pickup. causes a clot and makes its way to his lungs. we should do an arteriogram and find the clot and bust it with tpa.
there's no leak.
as soon as we're done with the arteriogram.
(puts up x-ray) take a look at this. bones of your forearm.
how about the wrist?
you all right?
you hit something?
lie flat.
it's the only chance to see what's going on.
it's going to be okay stevie. just inject the dye.
the clot's gotta be constricting the flow in the hepatic vein.
ow. the kid's liver's failing because of massive clots blocking his hepatic vein. how can he have both a bleed and a clot?
there's no heart failure or cirrhosis. means it has to be a clot.
a clot.
so could a granuloma from tuberculosis or sarcoidosis.
just hold still stevie. this shouldn't take long.
too bad it's all going to go to waste.
he should be able to pursue his own life not be stuck helping his parents sell old toasters.
listen unless he goes back to school i know exactly what he'll end up doing. wait. is that a lesion?
that means wegener's is most likely. (noise as door to room is opened)
your son is sick. the sign on the door says
it says no admittance.
your son is very ill. we're still trying to figure out why. which is why we need you to leave the room. (they leave)
what are you going to do now?
mri showed a granuloma in his liver.
no. clotting bleeding and a granuloma equals wegener's.
wouldn't be fair. we're going to biopsy the liver to confirm.
no.
no i don't.
what's with the clothes? you're not getting discharged.
we insist on our own gown food and furnishings for a reason.
wegener's causes the body to attack itself. it doesn't get undone overnight. be patient.
it's in the garbage.
willow bark extract is basically aspirin.
he's already on meds. our meds. we can't risk any adverse interactions. we need all this stuff to go. we need to control this environment.
that girl took pretty good care of your son while you were away.
all this stuff may make him feel more comfortable but it's not gonna
we should start to see some improvement in his liver functions soon.
be back in a little bit to check on you.
what is going on?
enough. no one is leaving.
is it your stomach again?
liver's actually improving. we plug one hole and end up poking another.
the wegener's treatment gave him a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.
what did i just say?
yeah. it was a very lovely day outside. on the other hand the treatment made him worse!
it's wegener's.
we could increase immunosuppression. add methotrexate.
mr. lippa with all due respect comparing this hospital with auschwitzit's ridiculous. and ft-28's been proven safe in hundreds
hey hey hey. do you think i don't understand what it's like to come from a people who've been enslaved mistreated and experimented on? tuskegee went on for 28 years after world war ii.
conventional therapy hasn't worked. your son may be dying. he needs a targeted approach and you need to trust us.
yes you're right. we're going to have to come up with something else.
the kind who avoids the house with the crazy couple who put tin foil over their windows.
what's that mean? (house sees dr. whitner coming down the hall starts maneuvering to intercept her)
what does paying for tin foil mean?
it's a cyclophosphamide. we're continuing the standard treatment as you requested. um i have to ask everyone to leave the room for a few minutes while i apply some bandages.
uh they're for his penis. (franklin gestures and they all file out)
we need to change your treatment. but your parents won't let us. they've got it in their minds that we want to try some sort of inhuman experiment on you.
ft-28's been through extensive clinical trials. it's also been used successfully for other conditions.
i'm sorry. we stop the pleural effusions your liver almost fails. we save your liver the bladder fails. if we don't get ahead of the curve on this
take the medicine but don't tell your parents.
the rest of the world though
you can trust me.
because if you do this then tell your parents i lose my license.
(to intercom) get in here.
keep him open. if i confirm wegener's we might as well stage the disease while he's still on the table.
external capsules ruptured but still intact. no signs of a clot or a bleed. normal follicles normal lymphoid tissue.
i don't see anything but normal spleen. no granuloma.
blood pressure's dropping.
ringer's lactate. got it.
they won't be able to transfer him until he's recovered from the surgery.
we should test him for von willebrand's.
ct sputum two venograms.
liver shut down. mri labs. treated with cyclophosphamide.
high resolution ct scan and ua and urine sediment.
he's in the icu now. his parents only have limited visiting privileges. (leaves)
blood pressure's dropping. he's bleeding again.
(looks out to check on house's argument with the lippas) hurry up.
wait wait. what's that.
no it's something. looks like a
toothpick.
he must have swallowed it accidentally and just figured he'd digest it eventually. when you two were making out in the car he must have folded awkwardly pushed the toothpick through the wall of the intestine and into the lung. then it moved on to his liver and made its way to his bladder and spleen.
yup. small holes. it shouldn't take that long to heal now that we've got it out.
yeah. that's it. wood absorbs water. becomes the same density as the tissue around it. that's why it didn't show up on the ct or mri.
you know the lab here they have a paid intern position. it's usually given to one of the kids from the universities but if you want i could probably get you an interview. there's some entry level stuff some gofer work. but you'd also have access to a lot of cool things.
yes you can. stevie you're bright. you have more curiosity than 90% of the doctors on this staff.
you could have both.
because they don't want to let you. they shouldn't be making you choose.
change is hard. trust me. i know. but it worked out for me.
she's gone to surgery.
there's a snowstorm. e.r.'s short staffed. we're all supposed to be here. you're supposed to be here. you're an ass. act surprised. (to hannah) this could sting a little. (house lounges in corner watching foreman clean a cut on hannah's leg)
make sure that 
whoa whoa. congenital insensitivity to pain is one of the rarest conditions on the planet. there's only been about sixty documented cases.
she says she's not.
on the other hand she says she doesn't have it. and she'd be dead by now if she'd never been diagnosed.
you said you had seven reasons.
five lame reasons aren't. i'm taking her to see her mom as (house whacks hannah on the shin with his cane. no reaction. foreman looks at house.)
i think there's a simpler explanation.
she won't consent.
no dad mom's still in surgery. what do you want us to do? hold her down?
we tried.
she's strong and doesn't care. we'd have broken something before we could get her to sit still enough to inject her.
you're cranky.
i'm so glad we're walking somewhere. another sixty feet and this conversation is over.
thirty feet.
i'm still with her aren't i?
could be drugs. she's smoked pot since she was eleven.
we're doing this case backwards. we do the tests and then she gets sick?
you want to risk paralysis because she's got a fever?
it's a fever.
any word from house?
maybe cuddy will say no.
you don't say no.
all the tests were negative.
just make your point.
you do know cipa means she can't feel pain.
naloxone and kinase proteins in.
they'll replace missing chemicals in your nerves. heightened sensitivity. we're going to be drilling directly into your skull. a response should indicate sarcoma.
ithurts. umsorry. bone pain is the worst there is. you need to let me know as soon as you feel anything. she's ready. (surgeon puts the drill in place)
just you and your mom huh? you two must be pretty close.
drugs?
you got an advantage.
you piss a lot of people off or you just trying to piss off your mom? those are pretty much the only two choices you have. hannah? (she's looking around nervous) you want us to stop? (hannah reaches for the metal frame) stop the drill. stop the drill! (foreman holds the frame while the surgeon removes the drill. hannah is making squealing pain/panic noises. foreman removes the frame.) it's okay. what'd you feel? where did you feel it? hannah i need to know how it hurt. (hannah smiles then pushes past foreman and runs out of the room.) hannah!
(enters) need you.
never did it.
can't.
she's going to jump off the lobby balcony.
your mother is fine. i just spoke to her surgeon.
you're trying to pull the same stunt in ten minutes.
could be a nerve disease.
makes sense given her glucose reation was slow and her potassium is down.
you're thinking peripheral neuropathy. we should take a nerve a little further away from the spine.
she'll survive. she knows the deal.
i know.
someday? come on. if there's one thing a good-looking woman can have whenever she wants it's a social life.
there's nothing wrong with a little companionship 'til the real thing comes along.
right.
nothing.
i have no idea what you had.
it's late. i'm cranky. sorry.
you married a dying man. you thought six months a year it'll be tough. but then i'll recover and i'll have the rest of my life. it's like willingly getting the flu or joining the peace corps. short term.
the sacrifices you made were huge. but they were at the height of your love for him. commitment is only commitment because it has no expiration date. you stand next to someone and watch them floss for 30 years like my parents have then ask for sacrifices. that's how you know the real thing. cameron i wasn't criticizing you. people who avoid commitment are people who know what a big thing it is.
cipa can't cause this much degeneration.
it tells us nothing. it wasn't physical pain it was emotional.
if she felt guilty she wouldn't be making her mother's life miserable. she wouldn't be getting into fights getting arrested
which is rational. if guilt is a symptom it's caused by the illness not by a thought process. and it would have to be new.
we already did. (holding chart) the e.r. gave her b12 when she was admitted part of a multivitamin supplement. apparently she's just sad.
are you having d<e9>ja vu? we've had this conversation. she was given b12. she didn't get better.
it's gotta be twenty five feet long.
sorry i screwed up valentine's day.
i did get you a gift. (handing her a large envelope) mgh <U+0096> best teaching hospital in boston. wanna be a nurse practitioner that's as good as it gets. (he moves away while she stares at gift) i made a few calls and you're in if you want in.
i thought you wanted
i've shared a lot of things with you.
wendy you think i'll stay with you because you're angry with me?
[hardly enthused] what's the emergency?
[annoyed] he page us at five in the morning for that? [scoffs] i'm going back to bed. [starts to walk out.] dystonia's not life-threatening. clonazepam will take care of tha...
[re-entering] then we treat with benztropine.
there is no case house. even if dystonia was some big medical mystery it's not this time.
savantism is just one of those things. it's... inexplicable.
raise your left hand.
[correcting] that's your right hand.
just wanna make sure whatever happened doesn't happen again. [to patrick] push up.
that's good. shows he's engaged.
[letting go of patrick's arm] spine's okay. alright stick out your tongue like this. copy me. [sticks out his tongue curling it at the sides.]
[chuckles] i know it's funny but copy me.
he's good to go.
motor cortex looks good. everything checks out.
[annoyed at being questioned like this] full battery of neurological...
patient had a foot problem.
there's no one else in here.
he's good. can we let him go?
fmri's not gonna show trauma.
think fmri's gonna show a big arrow pointing to a flashing sign saying savantism?
he had access to parts of his brain that you don't.
he's not savant at listening. he's a savant at playing. both listening and playing are different neurological processes.
[disbelieving] wha...?!
emotional response?
[wiping his hands] wasn't dystonia. he's got a heart condition that caused the arteries in his arm to constrict.
[shrugs and pouts] the chowder?
[putting on gloves] ambition's not one of his more prominent traits.
although...
he was testing blood in the clinic. don't think it was the patient's blood.
no he was checking for routine stuff.
makes sense if he's checking for basic medical clearance for employment.
almost at the heart. [looking at monitor] ____. aaand... done.
[urgently] supraventricular tachycardia. paddles!
clear!
cardiac arrest means we were wrong.
but no vasoconstriction. the heart problem couldn't have caused the hand problem.
we'd like to run some blood tests...
[giving up] anti-seizure meds don't prevent seizures they just make them manageable.
his brain it's gotten worse.
six-centimetre mass in his dorsal midbrain extending into the temporal lobe. [he turns around resigned] that's inoperable.
he's got a year.
[opening a file] here's a consent from boston for the cancer drug trial.
yep.
no. it's not even designed to work.
it's designed to treat depression in terminal cancer patients.
[loud] how can you focus on him?
harder than the right?
dr. peter hayes this is eric foreman at princeton-plainsborough. you were doing the signal transduction-inhibitor clinical trial. what kind of results did you...?
eeg was non-specific. where you gonna biopsy?
sssure. just put on a blindfold and play pin-the-tail-on-the-brain.
what if... we do the eeg from inside his brain?
[carrying on] it's risky and invasive.
external eeg could get confused if there are multiple structural abnormalities. if we perform the eeg inside the skull it could show us where to biopsy.
[hangs around] i'd also like to talk to you about...
yeah.
we'll use a small drill to get inside his skull...
yes. once we have twelve holes we'll surgically implant electrodes under the mengenies against the brain.
[voice over] and it's either cancer or autoimmune disease.
[voice over] yeah.
[voice over] neither.
hey.
we don't. i need to say something.
yeah.
[smug] sorry.
you're an arrogant ass... who makes it impossible for anyone to like him by punching people who don't deserve...
[softly] but i like you.
[irritated] will you shut up?
[sighs in frustration] inter-cranial eeg showed no electrical abnormalities.
no. also showed his entire right hemisphere is brain-dead.
he's gotten worse.
respiration is depressed. seizures are increasing one every five minutes.
i'm so sor...
what's this?
[covers patrick's left eye] what's this?
[to house] he's obviously lost the use of his...
what's it mean?
[smirks] wow then it's autoimmune.
's likely ones we can fix. polyarteritis nodosa takayasu or sarcoid. i'll start treatment.
[impatient] about time. can't let him go to boston if he qualifies for the duke trial.
[voice over] house! open up! [knock! knock! knock! knock!] open up! it's important!
[ecstatic] you don't have cancer. there was an abnormal presence of igc and igm indicating...
[reasoning] we just told you you're not gonna die. you should be making out with cameron!
you're right! i don't like you! [leaves]
the va is right there's no such thing as gulf war syndrome especially in veterans who've never served in the gulf war.
that can send you home in a pine box but it still can't get you sick 3 months after you've gotten home.
you send 700000 people on a vacation to hawaii some of them are going to come back sick doesn't mean it was caused by snorkelling.
that's it? you believe her but not me?
why'd you take this case?
you sure it's not just scrapes and bruises?
but you do work out and by the look of you pretty strenuously. that's not usually the case with patients whose principal complaint is chronic fatigue and joint pain.
besides low potassium probably caused by him overhydrating after working out. his blood work's all normal.
[scoffs.] what did you go to medical school in france? there's no trace of uranium in his urine. he was given the vaccines and meds 2 years ago without any allergic or adverse reactions.
if the levels are too low for us to detect they're way too low to cause any damage. [house continues walking right past the office.] where you going?
before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?
what's wrong?
nothing smells john.
how long have you thought... wait. [gets out his torch and bends down to look in john's mouth.] open your mouth [camera zooms in on john's tongue and we see all the little bacteria growing there camera goes back to foreman.] the smell's not in the room it's in your mouth. [chase followed by cameron walk in.]
good question.
because he hasn't been with anyone since his last girlfriend dumped him after he deployed to iraq the second time.
[sarcastic.] yea we'll get right on that. chronic fatigue joint pain and opportunistic infection spells cancer probably lymphoma. we should biopsy his tonsillar and submandibular lymph nodes
i don't. where were you two when the guy woke up?
to do what?
you didn't have any coffee when you came back.
house would do wilson before you'd do chase.
she was stoned! [continues laughing.]
[hangs up his phone.] his mother brother uncle and best friend all confirm he hasn't had a date in over a year which means it's not an std. if you come up with something medically relevant page me. [gets up and leaves.]
any older va couldn't have missed all these.
i'm ready. [starts the drill looks up the screen and notices something stops the drill.] wait a minute. zoom in. [nurse zooms the scan in.] i don't see it. you sure you got the right coordinates?
it's not there anymore.
it's not there. [foreman and wilson look at each other.]
it disappeared.
something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?
so you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant?
so you basically want us to do nothing?
no we're not. we should start treatment for the uranium toxicity like you said.
isn't here.
you have a better idea?
then we're going with chase's. [slaps chase on the arm and walks out chase follows.]
tell him not to get the lines tangled. the infusion is slow we can't have any kinks in the lines.
keep your arms on your body above your heart. [puts his arms over his chest to show john what he means.]
the paralysis is ascending if it keeps going we're going to need a respirator.
you have a nice night?
means it's getting worse.
we started him on sodium bicarb to try and flush the uranium out of his system.
sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on...
we had to do something.
how much more information could you possible want? we have a medical history going all the way back to his great grandparents. a non-medical history going...
he was only on the sodium bicarb...
the paralysis must have reached his diaphragm he's not able to oxygenate his blood.
you're bleeding. [house wipes his nose.]
you have a nice night?
how'd you know? [house walks out.]
this is definitely different.
urinalysis revealed excessive protein and red blood cells. chem panel showed a creatinine level over 2.5.
was our patient there? dengue fever avian pox. even west nile.
in her throat. that's the one about 10 inches above the heart.
we'll go look at the heart. [the fellows start to leave. house calls after them.]
you're vacationing in cambodia? you're going to unwind in the killing fields?
aren't those catfish critically endangered?
she needs dialysis. and we need a new theory.
or the pregnancy's irrelevant. could be infection sepsis hus/ttp <U+0096>
by one of the five we've already ruled out.
we did the labs. no one else had access.
could also be trisomy 13 epstein's anomaly an aneurysm of galen's vein <U+0096>
yeah. we'll just ask the fetus to lie very very still.
can't leave yet. liver failure puts her case back in the unsolved pile.
it's not gu. could be the heart. hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
the lungs <U+0096>
what do you want to do?
we eliminated all other possibilities.
he's not joking? [cameron gives him an exasperated sigh.]
we can't. her platelets are too low. once we pierce her liver it will be next to impossible to stop the bleeding.
so the sleep lab. you and cameron not sleeping. how serious is it?
then why are you doing it?
you're approaching the inferior vena cava. slow down. better not hurt her.
she does?
i'm not protecting her. i'm protecting myself. a heartbroken lovesick cameron would be even more unbearable than she is now. you're through the hepatic vein.
heart rate and bp spiking. get that out of her.
pre-term labor. start a terbutaline drip.
we're out of options.
not in this case. her body's trying to do what you refuse to <U+0096> get the baby out and save itself.
we don't have time for more tests. we have to terminate or she'll die.
giving the baby more than one course will suppress adrenal gland function.
house thought we should terminate six hours ago.
somebody's got to be cuddy's cuddy.
small buds in the lungs could indicate <U+0096>
higher resolution ct could give us a clearer <U+0096>
she can't wear motion-sickness patches for the rest of her life.
[throwing a tantrum] ugh! anything else you two guys won't agree on?
no i have a problem with the other thing you guys are doing which makes me question your motive for agreeing.
it could also be an allergy or something environmental. we should check her home.
right. i forgot there are no toxins in the us.
ct was a complete waste. she was negative for tumours her blood was negative for drugs heavy metals tropical diseases food poisoning and stds.
[sighs] we sure she's even sick?
there's no such thing. [over radio to fran] other eye.
no one does it well. women do it worse.
me. yeah.
that's her left eye. burst suppression on every lead.
her brain is shutting down because of intercranial pressure.
because of the increased pressure. she has a bleed in her brain.
[finishing] ... no tumors. but if she has an avm leading to a cerebral haemorrhage we coulda missed it. she needs a burr hole to relieve...
and her brain herniates and then she dies.
[whispers to wilson] here's a cliffhanger.
[under his breath disgruntled] sex better be damn good.
this thing is already all around her heart. if it gets into the muscle she's dead.
enough! [chase and cameron stop and look at foreman.] i take it you two aren't sleeping together anymore? we do what house said. we test for everything.
we eliminated dozens of wrong answers.
one and a half. we've eliminated two more conditions.
vision issues plus screwy heart equals some type of autoimmune. lupus and kawasakis are the most common in a 6-year-old.
what does that have to do with...
jra is an autoimmune disease. her body is attacking itself causing inflammation in the joints her eyes and her heart.
it can be crippling but it can also go into complete remission. the good thing is we caught it early. it gives her the best chance to have a positive outcome.
[to deran.] she's having a stroke.
the stroke was caused by a clot in her middle cerebral artery. started her on tpa. it should dissolve the clot and hopefully prevent brain damage but we wont know for sure until she regains consciousness.
jra doesn't affect the blood means the clot's a symptom of something else. [cameron walks in.]
lack of oxygen forces the body to over produce red cells.
your daughters vascular system is engorged with blood draining some reduces the chances of another stroke. we're also starting her on a drug that suppresses the production of red cells so we don't have to keep doing this. good chance she'll make a full recovery.
give her time.
a bloody t-shirt doesn't equal abuse. kids get hurt all the time.
[looking from chase to cameron] oh crap. you two are agreeing again.
or she had a nosebleed and grabbed a t-shirt.
but no physical signs. no marks on her body no bruises at all.
have you been abusing your daughter?
we found this. [shows him the bloody t-shirt.] hidden in a vent under her bed.
we need to examine her for abuse.
maybe you maybe the school bully maybe the creepy neighbour. i'm guessing that you're not paying as much attention as you should be. do you even know where your son is right now?
unfortunately that answer doesn't help me. if you have abused her you're obviously going to lie.
we need to do a vaginal exam.
you consent and we waste a few hours doing an exam or you refuse and i call social services and they waste three days doing an investigation which ends with them doing the exam anyway.
she's a little young to be cutting.
but do the cuts account for all that blood?
the other obvious source is forcible penetration.
what if our original assumption was wrong?
we found a t-shirt covered with blood hidden in a heating vent. how do we know it's even hers?
not the shirt. the blood.
we just tested the blood on lucy's t-shirt. it's full of endometrial cells.
we tested that too. it is.
it's menstrual blood. she's started puberty.
a tumour's most likely. a pituitary adenoma would send her hormone levels sky high.
frontal cortex is clean. moving caudally.
not interested. no masses in the hypothalamus.
i feel like i'm in a similar position.
you're an idiot. either she's lying or she's actually emotionally detached. which one sounds more like cameron to you?
you have to choose one. there's a bright spot on her left ovary. looks like a solid tumour.
[looking at the screen.] the mass is small. about a centimetre across.
you nick an artery?
she's in vtac no pulse. [grabs the paddles.] charging 50! clear! [shocks lucy.] clear! [shocks again.] clear! [shocks a third time. this time it works he feels for a pulse.]
[looks up from the microscope.] great plan. except the fact that her tumour's not a tumour. it's a benign cyst.
i'm feeling another late night... i'm gonna leave you two alone. [starts to leave.]
what? the answer's right there it's just a question of finding it. you don't need me for that. [leaves.]
not surprised. what's more likely? brother and sister get the same type of tumour at exactly the same time or they both play in the same toxic sandbox?
you just said there were no tumours. we scanned both their brains.
just trying to keep you that way.
[laughs.] trust me you don't want her cutting you right now. [finishes what he's doing walks over to where deran is standing.]
could be a function of the increased testosterone. hopefully he'll be a delight as soon as we figure this out.
where on your tummy?
stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas. found two more in her kidneys and one in her lung. they weren't there 48 hours ago. the hormones are making her body go haywire.
she's been out of her environment for 4 days and she's still getting worse.
it's called abuila the inability to make a decision or exercise will.
it's part of a t.i.a. a transient ischemic attack. blood was cut off to a section of your frontal lobe.
a little. what drugs have you taken recently?
toxins are another possibility. you might have been exposed to something at work for instance.
exposure can build up over time and lie dormant for a while. where was your last job?
exotic pets?
and before that?
arteries are clear no sign of a clot.
clots are unlikely in a 28-year-old who's not on the pill. it's probably a vasospasm caused by drugs.
she goes from job to job because she's a scam artist. she works just long enough to qualify for unemployment then gets fired and gets high. [house takes a vicodin for the irony you understand.]
her lp showed nothing no fever white blood count is normal.
you're the one always saying it must be drugs.
you know that's not what i <U+0096>
this isn't some romantic story of a nice girl scarred by tragedy. she's a drug-using scam artist scarred by tragedy.
you're wasting my time <U+0096> he's wasting my [all three finally notice that house isn't paying any attention to them and is in fact walking toward wilson's office.
i'll meet you outside. [chase walks off.] hey dad. gotta go but why are you here? everything okay?
you didn't bring mom with you?
i know we talked about it on the phone.
you didn't have to come.
i talk to her on the phone. she only knows who i am sometimes.
no.
or it could be drugs. [he holds up a vial.]
drugs can be laced with toxic substances <U+0096> arsenic rat poison. the drugs wash out of her system the toxins stick around.
absolutely except for the crack pipe. i'll test her blood for arsenic and rat poison.
you can show it to me later.
sure i'm okay.
yeah. everything is great mom.
that's why you brought the picture?
it was in your closet.
you might want to let him know he's got arsenic poisoning. we should get a sample of his hair so we can see the extent <U+0096>
get a crash cart in here! respiratory arrest!
doesn't matter what kind.
treatment is always steroids.
okay. it's affecting the larger blood vessels so it's gotta be giant cell arteritis. i'll start her on steroids. it's affecting her smaller blood vessels it's gotta be lupus vasculitis. i'll start her on steroids. it's affecting <U+0096>
good idea. [he leaves.]
how're you feeling?
you told me. are you tired?
your personal life is none of my business.
that's your imagination. i've seen every account of drug abuse no offense but you don't even stand out of the pack.
i'm not judging you now take a breath.
you make bad decisions every day of your life. stop doing drugs stop having fun go back to school and get your g.e.d.
your eyes. [shines a light in them]
there's yellow in the sclera. her liver's failing. without a transplant she'll be dead in the next 48 hours.
give her more of what's not working. this is not an autoimmune disease.
first brain then lungs now liver. all getting worse and all in two days. it's moving too fast! it's got to be cancer <U+0096> lymphomatoid granulomatosis. it's rare even by our standards but it fits her symptoms. explains why the steroids aren't working the poor fingernail growth <U+0096>
a lot of people don't have three organ systems shutting down! her blood vessels are taking this thing everywhere. she needs total body radiation.
running those immunochemstries can take a week she'll be dead by the time we <U+0096>
okay. suppose chase and cameron are right. suppose it's an autoimmune disease. what's the biggest danger of total body radiation? it suppresses the immune system which is what we're trying to do with the steroids anyway!
the patient is not too thrilled with me.
how do you feel?
deep breath.
shhh. i'm getting a murmur.
a lot of things can cause pain.
it's not cancer it's not autoimmune. it's an infection and we fried her immune system.
i'll tell her.
yeah. tell me how to do this. house says people thank you after <U+0096>
i already killed this woman. all i can do now is not make any more mistakes.
okay.
yeah.
you've got this down to a science.
i told you <U+0096>
i won't let her see it.
we think we think you have an infection.
it did what it was supposed to do. you're dying.
we can't know exactly.
less than 24 hours.
i'm sorry. it's true.
you don't have cancer. you came in with an infection. we didn't catch it.
it doesn't matter. the radiation was the worst thing we could have done. we destroyed the part of your body that was fighting it off. it spread to your heart <U+0096>
antibiotics work with the immune system but your immune system is non-existent because of the radiation.
it wouldn't help. the infection's everywhere. there's nothing we can do. i'm so sorry. we've called your grandparents.
nothing like a melodramatic gesture to solve everything.
i didn't help her i pulled the trigger.
are you trying to make me feel better?
i killed a woman don't you think it's appropriate i feel like crap for at least a little while?
where is he?
what are you doing?
it's not going to help her.
no.
you really don't care.
she's going to be dead <U+0096>
you'll have to wait. we're moving her back to her room.
icu isn't gonna help her. let's give her some privacy.
i'd like your forgiveness but i don't expect it.
no. your grandparents haven't arrived yet. if they don't make it on time is there anything you'd like me to tell them?
you got any friends you'd like me to call?
you were right about me.
i uh i had a problem with you. but you were wrong too. i've made some bad decisions. stole cars robbed houses.
but then i got another chance. left home went to college entered a whole nother world. and yet some part of me i can't get rid of thinks if i'm not the smartest if i'm not the first everywhere i go they'll figure out i'm not supposed to be here. they'll send me back.
i'll never be out of there. when i came home that last christmas i was in college it was like the rooms felt so small. it was so suffocating. but when i was standing on the stoop saying goodbye my mom put her arms around me. that was the last time i ever felt at home. i only put distance between you and me because i know there isn't any.
no.
time of death 3:35. do whatever you want.
no thanks. i've got paperwork.
i know.
i killed her.
this wasn't oh i should have thought of that idea sooner. this wasn't messing up a dosage. we see a disease rushing down on someone like a train we can't always get them out of the way. but this wasn't that.
so you're giving me numbers?
i did something bad mom. i hurt somebody.
it was.
do you know who i am mom? it's eric. [she nods and gives him another hug.]
[reading from the file] we should start the donor brother on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
five days minus twenty seconds talking about wilson's dog. we need to start testing. stool samples for parasites antibody tests...
we should do what we normally do - go to the kid's house check for sources of infection.
safer than intentionally making the kid sicker.
[examining a swing set] no-o whatever the kid got he didn't get from the kitchen or the bathroom. nobody cleans swing sets.
you obviously think your time could be better spent. why'd you come along?
i'm handling it.
she only had her grandparents and they weren't close.
you put yours behind you?
i woke up this morning i-i couldn't remember what she was wearing when i admitted her.
i'm not like you. your patient died because you were distracted over the death of your dad. i made a calculated decision. you acted like a human being. i acted like... house.
could be mucor or strongyloides in this dirt.
hey matty we found an old water pump in your backyard. you ever drink from it?
we gotta test for mycobacteria leptospirosis.
you sure? you haven't even taken a sip to cool off?
it's probably just a muscle ache. let us know if it gets worse.
something else bugging you?
he has acute scrotum.
can chase and cameron cover that?
i want to recheck the national marrow registry for an alternate donor.
it's been known to happen.
remove the valve? he'll be fine on antibiotics. he doesn't need open heart surgery.
it's insane!
i'm running this by cuddy.
this surgery is dangerous and life-altering. and clearly not in the interest of our patient.
we have a conflict of interest.
of course they do. they already sacrificed matty's health to benefit his brother once.
we screwed up his heart valve by making his cold worse.
or... it could be infection.
just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.
that's your argument? better outcome?
the family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune. wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.
it fits and we can still help big brother. national marrow registry came up with a four out of six donors.
we found a donor. it's not an ideal match. but four out of six still gives nick a chance.
i did the right thing.
why not?
we can still save matty. run more tests. find out what infection is destroying his marrow.
actually four months assuming the last one i test is the right one. if it's the first it'll take me approximately twenty minutes.
[cynically] but standing around here will.
negative for cmv.
he's called me a lot worse.
[ignoring it] even if we run a hundred tests that only gives us a one percent chance of saving these kids.
[still circumventing the topic] i don't know there's got to be a way to better our odds from ninety-nine percent chance of death.
it's not food-borne because no one else in the family is sick.
matty's the only one who drank from that water pump in the backyard but we eliminated pseudomonas and cholera.
they do. why?
get nick back to the clean room!
we figured out what's wrong with matty.
histoplasmosis.
fungal infection. grows in chicken feces. the dirt that matty used to build his pitcher's mound must have sat under a chicken coop. your whole neighborhood was built on top of farmland. we didn't test for it earlier because we...
full course of amphotericin and he should be fine.
that's it.
your brother was willing to risk his life to save you. are you willing to do that for him?
i... can't sedate you. you're too sick.
[not ready to stop now] sorry. i need a lot more.
i did what you would have.
i tortured the kid.
[pensively] i know. i don't like that i know. i hate that i can listen to a kid screaming in pain and not even take a moment to question whether i'm doing the right thing. i hate that in order to be like you as a doctor i have to be like you as a human being. i don't want to turn into you.
[turns to face him] you'll save more people than i will. but i'll settle for killing less. consider this my two weeks' notice.
no fever no elevated white count which rules out infection.
er also ran an upper and lower gi. no occult blood in her stool.
rupture in her sinus cavity dripped through the back.
yeah.
thank you.
no.
i resigned.
you can have my parking space my locker.
[sarcastic.] let me get all sensitive and confide in you. [pushes the microphone button.] addie pedal harder. need your heart rate at 170. [addie pedals faster.]
i don't like you. never have never will. you want me to share some more?
oooh. no recovering from those babies.
she wasn't cold her temperature was normal.
what? a brain problem? messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood. she has no neurological issues. she had a shiver.
we've ruled out infection because no fever no white count. [they stop in front of wilson's office.
lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.
yawning is a symptom of fatigue or cholinergic excitation.
because i wasn't kissing his ass.
pressure is collapsing her lungs. she's not getting any air.
heart was fine liver enzymes were normal.
it is significant. it means there's no infection.
there's no diagnostic test for complement factor-h deficiency.
most likely cause of altering blood flow in the brain is a clot or a tumour.
which means we should be looking for a tumour.
she needs an mri of her brain.
i didn't expect house to beg me to stay but it seems like he's in a better mood since i quit. nothing in the axial view. you haven't asked me why i'm leaving.
i don't want to be like him.
[laughs.] thank you.
better at some things worse at others.
it's easier for you.
yeah. see? i am a jerk i've got to get out of here.
brain's clean no tumour and no abscess. we're all wrong.
looks like massive tissue death.
here we go again.
you enjoying this?
no it's much more likely she has an invisible protein that allowed bacteria to arbitrarily invade her lungs then arbitrarily invade her pleura then arbitrarily jump into her head.
you wanted to see me? [wilson puts his hand up to say wait and continues trying to fix the label. foreman leans over and has a look.] pretty sure the label is straight.
i'm not sure.
are you ok?
he said that?
are you sure you're ok?
you're happy about this.
i'm not telling her.
but we're going to wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her?
her heart went into v-fib. brought her back barely. congratulations you have your confirmation. [house gets up and starts to leave presumably to tell addie she is going to die. foreman calls out after him.] what's her name?
sure.
you know her father's name?
ben and jodie are about to lose their only daughter addie.
you saying you don't want me to quit?
you are about to tell a girl she is dying and you think it's about you. god i hope i'm not you. [leaves.]
what's up?
you wanted to see me?
house's patient.
subtle.
don't tell me i'm better than him. don't tell me to take the good leave the bad. cameron already tried.
it's not worth it. [leaves.]
nate went medieval on the other kid. could be...
which could create excess adrenaline. causes the head pain and rage.
there is no personality disorder. he's a teenager.
if it were just a cluster headache he'd have swelling around the eyes.
i'll do it. but i've got a job interview after work. anything comes up later you guys handle it.
thanks.
it's safe. the magnetic pulses activate nerve cells which will hopefully squelch the head pain.
from the fights?
you're already on pain meds. nothing more i can do.
[smirking] i'll get the word out that you're a great guy.
because i'm black?
[hardly amused] the thing that cameron said.
hey!
i had a job interview lined up at new york mercy yesterday.
[mad] didn't happen because apparently i called to cancel. i don't remember making that call. you think i have neurological issue?
[shouting] why are you jerking me around?
yeah! it was one of the other petty socially repressed asses i work for.
if you want me to stay tell me you want me to stay.
no but it'd be the adult way to handle it.
i've been totally professional! gave two weeks notice continued to work cases! scheduled my interviews on my own time! you have no right to screw with my future.
[monotone] i'm listening.
wilson's disease.
[resigned look] angry teen... alcohol.
chase and cameron would mutiny if they found out.
[looks uncertain] i've only been doing this for three years.
and when that case comes along that i can't figure out? you know who i'd have to go to.
[sighs] no.
he's evil.
how do you know?
well somebody did it. somebody here did it. i can't work here.
liver's properly converting the ammonia into urea. he doesn't have otc deficiency.
sorry. i shouldn't have been taking my problems out on the patient.
and what are we looking for?
it's just a few more hours.
nate don't.
his uric acid's slightly elevated.
could be hepatic fibrosis or mcadd. brat's got a genetic disorder.
i can draw some blood but then i gotta run.
you gonna stop me if it is?
sedative.
i did. just shutting him up so i can draw some of his blood in peace.
people are what they are.
if he had tuberculosis it wouldn't be his fault either. but i still wouldn't let him cough on me.
i like this kid.
they're gonna let me know.
no. amyloidosis can cause seizures and the protein buildup could cause organ failure.
[beat] my last boss.
you're not being objective.
you were right it doesn't fit the symptoms.
you crossed it off because you wanna hate the kid. and you can't hate him if he's a victim...
nate i'm gonna take a small piece of nerve from your ankle. let me know if you feel any pain.
wish i could. but your body has to be clear so it's ready for a marrow transplant.
it's all right.
[calmly] we're doing our best.
nerve biopsy was clean. no evidence of amyloidosis.
he's running a fever. if it's two conditions one of them's gotta be an infection. we should start him on antibiotics see what clears up what doesn't.
yeah he has mucus in his chest from an infection.
[not turning back] you just here to watch or you got something to say?
yeah. still nothing.
it all fits as long as these symptoms started when you think it started.
she has ms. explains the pain the fatigue double vision kidney problems.
it is possible for two people to have the same symptom for 2 different reasons.
we could do that or we could do something productive start her on interferon for the ms see if she improves.
i know it's not a pleasant diagnosis to hear-- [marina is very distressed and crying]
it's alright the pulse oximeter just came off. [he clips it back on to her finger] marina you can't--
does this hurt? [he experimentally twists her arm and ends up breaking her wrist she screams in pain]
which leaves bone cancer.
and you're the one who said if we do that we might as well throw out everything we got from the husband.
no tumours in her arm sinovial membrane's working fine.
what?
since when does house make sense?
he's angry.
did you fire him for me?
no!
a clot means a heart problem we have to do an emergency angiogram.
pet scan can't determine that with certainty.
we've ruled out ms.
doctor house has left for the night; he'll be here in the morning to review the results if you sign the consent.
but you know you could call him at home. he doesn't always pick up so keep calling. [he writes down house's no. and gives it to esteban]
catheter's in her femoral artery.
because you're assisting.
i had nothing to do with chase's termination.
you're doing fine marina. the dye will take a minute to work its way through your system.
because it's the truth.
let me get this straight instead of picking up the phone and talking to a patient for 5 minutes you gave up on sleep and you drove in here.
she's in v-tach.
nothing!
she has no pulse.
i didn't nick an artery it just stopped.
no st segment changes. we need to tell the husband.
5 6 7 8.
half an hour more of this nothing to talk about won't be able to bring her back. we gotta get her on bypass.
[points to another nurse] you get in here. [he swaps positions with the nurse and then walks out]
[walks up to house on the balcony] house time's up.
either our patient goes on bypass or i call time of death.
3 hours!
her heart stopped we have to get her on bypass.
[gets up] i will miss you. [he hugs her]
it's too late for theories; we need to tell the husband.
that it's over.
if he pulls the plug it means you failed.
[walks in] she's 3 hours off bypass and still stable. and the pain is gone.
just because it was there before doesn't mean it's coming back. chase was probably right she had some sort of tropical infection that cleared when we put her on antibiotics during the bypass.
because it stopped.
this is where--
looks like you're wrong.
[shrugs] well this is it. i appreciate the opportunity you gave me.
thanks i guess.
i know. but i don't need you and i definitely don't want to be you. you're miserable.
for 2 minutes maybe until the next case comes along until you're jonesing for your next fix. this woman talks while in full cardiac arrest and you're more excited about the talking than the heart dying.
i don't want to solve cases i want to save lives.
i care.
