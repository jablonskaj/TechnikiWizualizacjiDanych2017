aneurysm stroke or some other ischemic syndrome.
mad cow?
thankfully no. i'm dr. chase.
[over intercom] ok we're gonna begin.
it's all right. just try to relax.
ah she probably fell asleep; she's exhausted.
it'll just be another minute.
yep coming.
good call.
we'll get that tube out of your throat later today.
just part of your treatment. you haven't had many visitors. no boyfriend?
well what abut work? you must have friends from work.
we're just trying some alternative medications. so where's your family from then?
the tests weren't really conclusive.
you should have told her the truth. it's a long shot guess.
false hope.
could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure?
she didn't respond to the radiation.
tapeworm?! you think she's got a worm in her brain?
reproduce? there's only got one lesion and it's nowhere near her bowel.
it's only abnormal in 30% of cases.
i think we can prove it's a worm. it's noninvasive it's safe. i'm not completely sure but[interrupted]
have you ever seen a worm under an x-ray a regular old no contrast 100-year-old technology x-ray? they light up like shotgun pellets. just like on a contrast mri.
hold still rebecca.
this here is a worm larva. [chase pointing to x-ray of her leg]
are you looking for a guarantee? it's there probably been there 6 to 10 years.
probably. it's good news.
now we get you better. albendazole.
yeah every day for at least a month with a meal.
yeah possible side effects include abdominal pain nausea headache dizziness fever and hair loss. we'll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those.
feeling any better?
as you know the hospital has certain rules and as you also know we tend to ignore them but i think this one's gonna be a little obvious unless we get your help.
9 letters iodine deficiency in children.
huh [fills in the space]
maybe not that bad could be an infection.
why would you say that?
it doesn't necessarily have to be that bad. if we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic: his liver kidneys something outside the brain.
the night terrors were anecdotal. he could have had a bad dream.
parents said?
that's a night terror.
meningeal enhancement. my bet is viral meningitis.
so what did you find?
it looks ok.
there's some bowing there. an upward arch.
yes.
nah house isn't gonna pay you based on that.
we could tell them he's got huntington's. the whole family should be tested or they'll all die.
i've scheduled him for surgery. they're gonna put a shunt into one of the ventricles to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.
oligoclonal bands and an increase of intrathecal igg.
no lesions on the mri.
it'll take months for a definitive diagnosis.
ms is an incredibly variable disease if it is ms and we're not 100% sure.
there are some medications to manage the symptoms but as the disease progresses the problems will become more severe: bowel and bladder dysfunction loss of cognitive function pain.
the brain's like a big jumble of wires. ms strips them of the insulation and the nerves die. the brain interprets it as pain but by starting treatment we're gonna avoid that for as long as possible. we're looking into a couple specialists and until we get you squared away you'll stay here. ok?
dan?
dan? you ok? [pause] there are experimental treatments ongoing research who knows what they'll discover in a year or two?
dan we're standing on the roof of the hospital! dan! dan you're not on the field!
foreman!
dan.
that the immune system is working.
sorry rpr was negative.
no idea you just asked if i thought there was one.
the treatments should start helping soon. let us know if it gets easier to focus on things remember stuff.
hey dan isn't dr. cameron's necklace a beauty? something south american i think.
the kid's in pain.
no what?
dan? you ok?
[muffled] dan? [regular] push three milligrams iv stat!
penicillin's not working.
too young for anything degenerative.
mri was clean.
and we've tested for anything remotely possible. everything is negative.
no eastern equine encephalitis.
what's that?
you're not gonna believe this the mother's not the mother either.
we're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.
absidia infection?
the kid's got abdominal pain. maybe carcinoid?
you all right?
we have a few theories we're working on.
i'm not sure scaring your boyfriend is the best medicine for him right now.
don't go rock climbing.
what you you're wondering if whatever he has you might have gotten it? it's unlikely we ran a complete std panel so 
we should test the girlfriend's theory. she thinks she rode him to death.
well i told her 22-year old men don't die of sex.
what do you mean?
have you ever taken a life? [cameron gives him a dirty look. foreman gets the lab results from the printer.]
except we checked for abdominal infections.
it's a 10 million to one shot.
orange and green? two conditions contracted simultaneously?
we'll run the tests.
tell the family house's theory?
they agree to treatment?
what? because we don't hate him? he thinks outside the box is that so evil?
seven down about 5000 to go. you really think we're going to come up with your mystery virus by running gels until we guess it right? [we see that cameron is in a separate part of the lab from foreman and chase.]
i'm waiting for the epstein barr virus. [looks at cameron] she's weird isn't she?
what?
what did i say? is weird some new ghetto euphemism for sexy like bad is good and phat is good? then what the hell does good mean?
no.
obviously the girl is hot. you you're not talking about her aesthetics you're talking about if i want to jump her. i don't.
what's going on? [cameron abruptly stops laughing.]
who told him?
ah!
you haven't said anything.
oh i don't even remember what you said.
well we don't have to talk about this
hey foreman!
can you walk brandon?
all right okay. cause we'll need to leave the chair outside. [to the nurse helping him] thank you. where's april? april! [april comes in.] can you take the chair please? [to brandon] i'll need to take your mask and your robe too. you might want to block your ears for this it's quite loud. [they're blasted with air. next we see cameron foreman the merrells and mindy watching chase and brandon in the clean room.)
um are we talking about brandon?
but he doesn't have gout. why would he have gout medication?
we need to know exactly what you put in this bottle. we think it was colchicine a gout medication.
the family is prepared to waive liability all right? we just need to know what it was what dosage it was 
[gives him the bottle] refill it.
this is cough medication. this is what brandon was supposed to get. [he shakes out three onto his hand.] they're small round and yellow. can you tell this man what the pills in your son's medicine bottle actually looked like?
i think the catheter's curling in the atrium.
ectopy. you must have irritated the heart wall.
he can't tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia. pull back.
you still with us brandon?
charging. clear! [shock.] sign of rhythm.
dr. house this is a clean room.
you should invite dr. house.
no but he'll send a gift.
hey you want to go get some 
[half-wave] we'll see you later.
[closing the door to the room] yep. we've definitely checked the whole floor. [they meet up with house and foreman by the elevator.] good news no epidemic.
spiking fevers.
virus? [house writes virus.]
vre?
and the urine tests show no casts.
they both can cause this. there's no way to know which one it is. no test. [house looks at chase.]
so we take our best guess then. which drug's causing the kidney failure?
they have the same disease you want to give them different treatment?
hi.
her fever's been stable the last hour.
sorry?
um what happens to patients after they leave the hospital i don't know but try not to get ahead of yourself. [beeping is heard inside the nicu. chase goes back in.]
how long?
pulse? [nurse mutters something.] fluid wide open. do we have an arterial line?
let's get a bp. [karen walks into the nicu.] you can't come in here.
mrs. hartig 
it's not your baby!
fenlay bp 60 over 20. [house walks into the nicu and stands next to wilson.]
still dropping. 50 over 10.
v-fib.
charging. clear. [cgi of inside the baby's chest. we see that the shock does nothing to jumpstart the heart.]
charging. clear. [another shock] charging. clear. [cgi shot shows no movement.]
charging. clear. [shock] charging.
i'll do it.
the hartig baby. she's getting sicker too. the vancomycin isn't working either.
it could be vrsa.
one of the kids the hausen baby had a skin rash. it could be scalded-skin syndrome which would be a sign of vrsa.
you're talking vials not stick tests? i wouldn't take more than five or six.
well it it only seems to hit children. the mothers aren't sick so
cmv?
eight vials of blood is pushing it.
all done all done.
no it's great. [ethan and karen start to laugh and cry.]
chest ct'd be quicker.
the sister?
aw. i hate nuns.
do you consider it the work of the devil or do you just not get cable where you live? [pause]
all i know is if house didn't make a mistake and sister augustine has churg-strauss he'll be self-satisfied and our lives will be good for a few weeks. if house did make a mistake he'll be upset and our lives will be miserable for months.
not really.
cool.
you know the staff better than i do.
yet you live in a monastery.
our lord maybe. the rest of the world on the other hand would probably get more out of feeding the homeless or 
as an example yeah.
always. you always want to be a nun?
i believe sister augustine has no vascular pathology which means no churg-strauss.
religious visions?
mixed connective tissue disease. it'd explain why she was feeling better on the prednisone.
the pressure will force the oxygen into your system and saturate your blood. it will enhance white cell activity and reduce the inflammation.
we'll be doing about ten treatments and then we'll reevaluate.
how're you feeling?
that's from the oxygen.
okay. well i'll get you some of your tea.
the sister's breathing is labored.
bun and creatinine's rising alt and ast twice the normal range.
these pills will help your kidneys function a little better sister. [she takes the pills.] get your wrist? [he takes her pulse.]
104.
it's fine.
i have to get this. excuse me.
my mother's been dead for 10 years.
which one?
her parents died when she was a child and she's been with the church ever since.
why do you say that?
i don't know nuns.
know any nazis? maybe i hate them on principle.
i think if she did have a secret her boss would know. [he leaves.]
yeah she's getting worse. lung function's deteriorating bun and creatinine are continuing to rise. she's starting to run a fever and the rash is spreading. at this rate she's not going to make christmas.
damned if you do damned if you don't.
the dish soap.
we'll skin test for allergens.
get her in a clean room.
we'll be back to check on you in a little while.
it'd be better if you don't have any visitors. once we isolate what's causing your allergy then we can be a little more lax. [augustine turns away from the window and starts to cry.] i can pray with you.
i was in seminary school. they asked us once what our favorite passage was. i chose 1 peter 1:7. these trials only test your faith to see whether or not it is strong and pure. your faith is being tested as fire tests gold and purifies it.
he hasn't left you. the only thing in the way of your knowing if he's left you is your fear. you have a choice: faith or fear. that's the test.
it will affect how you experience your death and therefore your life. it's up to you.
a test. you passed. i didn't.
need some help in here! [cameron and foreman start to suit up.] screw the procedure she's in anaphylactic shock!
you kidding me? get in here! [cameron and foreman run in.] 0.1 cc of epi.
it's a clean room!
sister augustine's been extubated.
she's requested to check out against medical advice. she wants to go back to the monastery.
i think i may have talked her into it.
what if she refuses?
it's clean as a whistle. what's house looking for? [foreman shakes his head and then squints at the screen.]
don't know.
wouldn't she know she had an iud?
so all we have to do is remove the iud 
-- and the symptoms should subside.
prolonged exposure to an allergen with minimal symptoms. but at some point all it takes is one last contact to cause a full-blown reaction. it's like a balloon filled with air. one last breath it explodes.
and all your subsequent symptoms came from ingesting food prepared in it.
i doubt he'll interpret it that way.
the prodigal son.
we'll schedule your surgery for tomorrow.
i don't know who i am anymore.
he likes crazy people. likes the way they think.
they're not boring. he likes that.
the tremors aren't new  she must always cut herself.
the clotting studies. pretty fast  you promise to date the entire lab?
if it'd happened at home she would have died. that er doc he was gonna send her home.
it's more likely than malnourishment. why not scurvy or the plague?
alcohol. simple. it causes immobility which explains the dvt. it also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged pt time. let's ultrasound the liver.
101. [ pulls credit card out of his wallet to open door struggles to open the door with it ]
looks like luke sleeps in the living room.
enough organization enough lists you think you can control the uncontrollable. fix her meds fix her clothes maybe you can even fix her.
oh god i hope it's not a vitamin k deficiency.
[ groans ] damn.
i still don't buy a vitamin k deficiency.
the kid feeds his mum a steady diet of booze and the problem is too many burgers?
feeding alcohol to an alcoholic is not a survival technique.
yeah right. i'm rich i couldn't possibly understand what this kid is going through. just because you're drinking pricier stuff doesn't mean you don't have a problem.
no way vitamin k's the whole story.
house write new orders?
it's cirrhosis. but she doesn't drink!
a tumor. cystic?
we do nothing she dies from liver failure within 60 days.
joe bergen does the knife thing -- laser cauterizes while it cuts saves more liver.
it looks like the surgeon got it all but she's gonna have to have some chemotherapy.
luke stop writing. [ he sits down at the table with luke ] if you stop for a second it's not all gonna fall apart. give yourself a break once in a while. the fact is your mum's gonna have an extra drink every now and then.
fine. there are some things you just can't fix that's all i'm saying.
no. i'd do it just like you. it's an infusion. [ hands him a pamphlet ] she's gonna have a drain in her abdomen you're gonna have to check for possible infections.
[ standing up ] can i help you? this is a private room.
15?
where are you taking him?
the madness of king george.
oh uh wilson's disease?
put your hands on the bar and your chin in here. thank you.
[ coming in ] hi mrs. palmeiro ready to go home?
what about parasites? malaria chagas?
you mean she claims she's never been outside the u.s.
it could be just postictal disorientation.
late stage lyme disease can cause seizures.
how can a disease caused by a tumor present if there's no tumor?
and how do you treat it if there's no tumor?
why?
meaning?
infection?
tularemia initially presents with a rash or ulcer near the infection site.
so this should tell us whether or not she's got rabbit fever?
a single titer over 160 would be a big clue.
[smirks] actually i think he said your idea was a lousy idea.
the treatment for tularemia can cause aplastic anemia.
he's got a crush on you. he just doesn't know how to show it.
and the treatment for sleeping sickness kills one in ten patients.
to what?
oi where'd you find that
they're overcompensating for guilt.
before the sleeping problems did you have any trouble breathing a cough that wouldn't go away anything like that?
are you certain?
have you ever had an affair?
you sure?
and special iv tubing.
because melarsoprol melts plastic. this stuff's supposedly arsenic mixed with antifreeze.
nietzsche wouldn't have been so glib if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.
forgot to say it's gonna hurt like all hell.
fever spiked at 104. echo shows global hyperkinesis.
barely 90 over 40.
started 270 micrograms per minute ten minutes ago still no change.
killing her parasites isn't gonna do much good if we kill her heart at the same time.
right now were killing both. [to house] if she's gonna die we should at least let her do it without that acid flowing through her veins.
viral myocarditis?
or he od'd on something we didn't test for. 14-butenediol would give you these symptoms.
1 milligram
matt did you take any drugs this morning?
[sticks his fingers in matt's hands] can you squeeze my fingers for me? [matt doesn't move] did anyone give you anything to help with the math test? matt?
ms. davis all parents think that about their children. and they're usually wrong. i gave my mum a little trouble when i was his age. i turned out ok even she thought so.
did he go anywhere last night?
any friends come over to help him?
ms. davis
then why did you test him?
has he ever had any problems like this before? any family history of [machine beeps. to the nurse] diazepam 10 milliliters stat. [he rolls matt onto his side]
just some precautions. [matt starts seizing. chase grabs him around the shoulder] he's seizing. [nurses rush in mom worries; chase mutters a bunch of stuff from which i only caught calm him down]
pralidoxime is very effective; it just takes a little time for it to kick in.
the blood work was pretty conclusive. it's an organophosphate.
[hurries to the other side of the bed] get back. ms. davis move back please. [to the nurse] we're at 30 ready cardiac arrest. get me the pads.
we're going to beat his heart for him. [he places the pads on matt's chest. to nurse] set it to sixty.
we'll keep him on the pads for another hour.
let's see what happens.
the pralidoxime isn't doing him any good we're going to have to wire his heart.
what's the success rate?
minimal at best. the poison's broken the blood-brain barrier.
i'm australian.
if we don't know what poison we're dealing with we don't know which hydrolase to ask for. there's over forty organophosphates-
i'll keep the kid alive for a while at least. [leaves]
through the superior vena cava into the right atrium through the tricuspid valve and lodging into the wall of the right ventricle.
that won't do. get him to fifty.
the poison is called disulfoton. this should bond with it and neutralize the poison. then his nervous system will start sending the right messages to the rest of his body.
the label says disulfoton; i can show you.
you said matt sprayed with it this morning before school.
apparently he cheated a little.
the symptoms fit. there must have been some left in the can.
well theoretically it could increase the toxicity and-- but we're not wrong. [about to inject the medicine into the iv]
we're not wrong.
on three. one two three... [they move the boy]
[puts the stethoscope around his neck] saline atropine and diazepam now.
the second kid's heart is almost as weak as matt's; were gonna have to get him wired up too. and i don't know how long matt's brain's gonna hold up; his hearts not pumping enough oxygen.
eighty percent.
we're risking damage to his retina.
i'm the primary.
she complained? about me?
i was trying to get information; it was a strategy.
[raps sharply on said door shouts through the glass] two kids were poisoned on your bus this morning. they're dying. [idiot bus driver opens the door]
neither is being obnoxious. looks like you're in the clear. [gets on the bus to start testing]
or mine.
seizing. suction
10 milligrams.
matt's alts are up to 800. if they get any higher we can toss his liver.
so the detergent was contaminated with pesticides?
his clothes are all new?
now what?
they're ruddy old jeans i think. they've been bagged up and taken downstairs.
yep they're matt's. and they're old
chi's are a different brand how could they both be contaminated?
not this time. matt's mom won't do anything until she gets that opinion from the cdc.
[hands house a cell phone. in a fake southern accent-] the cdc is unable to give an opinion at this time and we're gonna have a doctor in your area next week.
staying in the 90s on the nasal canula.
guillain-barre which would be reversible.
antibodies could be attacking the nerve. multifocal motor neuropathy.
0-2 stats are dropping.
junky.
he won't last long enough for it to work. we've got to intubate him stat. [cameron starts to bring over the equipment.]
what?! [cameron chase and foreman are left standing around his bed.]
10 minutes.
he's dnr. [house looks at them all and shoves his cane at chase. he starts to intubate john himself.]
he's stable on the ventilator. oxygenating well.
uh vasculitis?
there are case reports of wegener's hitting both the legs and the spine.
every four hours.
why?
biopsy only shows inflammation.
you can't do any more tests but you want me to treat him?
he can't move his arm.
so why didn't you just tell him yes?
right.
don't need the money.
he knows we disagree with his choice.
[looking at the screen] whoa whoa whoa what's that?
well done cameron.
yeah he's just a lucky lucky guy.
there's a good chance we can still bust the clot with tpa.
we're in your carotid artery. this is going to take us all the way up into your brain.
something he's on is working.
but if we stop everything he'll get worse.
steroids for the pneumonia.
thin cuts.
t9 through the quarter-equinus same as the last time. you really think house would let foreman out of his contract?
intradural compressing his spine. [chase puts up the scans.]
you saying it just grew overnight?
nothing.
scar tissue? inflammation?
brain tumor? [foreman enters]
a blow to the head? a subdural hematoma?
uhhh trying to make me hurl?
nice likeness of dr. foreman. in fact he's never looked better.
that's okay. he doesn't like me either. who's james?
pain in your head?
good news is she's negative for hiv and hep-c.
there's a two day wait for non-emergency mris.
which means that girl had surgery just so you wouldn't get reamed out by cuddy.
[to cameron] grab some epi off the code cart. [checks pulse] respiratory arrest call the code!
she's not getting any air. got the epi. [is handed it gives victoria shot in arm]
we have about another minute. [attaches oxygen mask]
there's a billing record from hartman hospital last year. two appointments ultrasounds doesn't say what for.
only if she was expecting an elephant. the appointments were ten months apart. kept the first blew off the second.
[snorts]
hang on her current blood work doesn't show cancer. ca125 is normal.
why are we on this case?
i think house just wants to prove she's sick so foreman will be wrong.
hey i'm just doing my job. [looks at ultrasound] whoah. [pauses] foreman's going to be so embarrassed when he finds out she's got cancer.
oh you're joking.
good news! it's a tuberculoma.
[holds up paper] it's the lab results from the biopsy it's definitely a tuberculoma.
the lab checked the biopsy again twice.
then it's a tuberculoma and something else.
a fever that high has to be bacterial.
might want to get her in an ice bath as well assuming we want her to live long enough to see those test results.
urine cultures are negative.
we know it's definitely an infection. and we know where it is.
it must have worn off.
i'll check the nurse's station. [leaves]
security tape confirms it she stole some clothes and she's gone.
it doesn't make sense. what would push her heart rate over 150? dehydration? fever?
there've only been what 20 cases in the last ten years?
there's no treatment.
you want us to recheck?
drugs'll fit just as much as lupus. meth'll cause hemolytic anemia.
because his dad drives a porsche? rich kids do drugs just like poor kids.
it's not that we don't trust you but [he pulls one of keith's hairs with tweezers]
negative.
negative for drugs. ana was negative gallium scan was clear
which eye?
it's all right. just look down for me? [he looks into his eye with a pen light. we see that keith's vision is getting dimmer and dimmer.] it's clear. there's nothing in it.
you can't use bloodthinners he's got internal bleeding. fix the eye you kill everything else.
we have two hours to figure this out. either we restore the blood flow or he loses the eye. [house walks in from his office. he does not look as earlier.]
it makes no sense they're opposing processes. [wilson walks in.]
most likely candidate for throwing a clot is infection or cancer.
cardiac.
[looks at the untouched food] not a fan of the stroganoff?
the antibiotics can cause nausea.
the blood clot isn't life-threatening. we're focusing on figuring out the cause of your problems.
looks like you had a masseuse. help the pain?
i know. kid's echo was normal no sign of any vegetations on heart valves.
and the antibiotics aren't doing anything.
that'll box his kidneys for sure!
also i have an idea for his eye.
he's got a clot in his retinal 
if we remove some of the liquid from the eye itself the vitreous humor it might make some extra room around the retinal artery.
well i didn't think of it before.
your eye's numb. you'll only feel pressure. [a second needle enters. cgi shot of the needles in the eye.] give it a minute. [keith's vision begins to clear.]
alt and gdt were in the tank. our antibiotics 
because he said something inappropriate? if we sent him home every time he did that we wouldn't need this office.
he's toast.
we'll know it's not hep-e and start treating him for lupus.
hep-e is possible. house always pulls these stunts and he's right more often 
like he's going to fire you he loves you. [elevator dings]
that will get you fired.
he's fine. he knows what he's doing. [chase leaves. cameron stops holding the button and the doors close.]
if it is hepatitis-e we should begin to see a marked decline in liver function tests within the hour.
keith? what's wrong?
keith? it's dr. chase where does it hurt?
we haven't started the medicine.
don't worry about it it's fine. let's get you up. [they turn him over to find a massive amount of blood on the bed.]
he's going into hypervolemic shock. pressure's 60 heart rate's 140.
he's also hallucinating. thinks he's being talked to by someone named jules.
and she made herself quite clear.
it's the best diagnosis we've got.
there's no way to really tell what progression the disease may take 
sorry you're a different blood type.
it was a hallucination.
not long.
he was being attacked by an animal that wasn't in the room. that's psychosis.
talking instead of digging. come on the ground's frozen solid. [foreman starts to help dig. they hit something hard.]
healthy? he's in the toilet!
i'm telling hourani to re-scrub. we're doing this transplant.
you said it! if keith's symptoms had an environmental cause they would have disappeared as soon as he got here.
hey! take it easy. [house touches his lip which is bleeding.]
none of the usual suspects! age isn't right in apparent perfect health before this incident mri and pet scan negative for tumors.
that'd explain the weight gain. and the kidney problems.
we're gonna need a urine sample.
mr. wiggen? the urine sample.
if you say so. [moves to the other side of the room]
he sure does. [smiles and points to the catheter bag that is collecting urine from hank.]
if you throw out the kidneys everything else adds up. the testicles the bones the impaired liver function could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.
negative for steroids. [grins]
you got a text message though. friday night-very cryptic.
oncology seminar. friday night the same thing as the car trouble?
house says you were lying. i believe him.
hey i like the guy. he says what he wants does what he wants.
or needs a thousand bucks. [foreman laughs] what is with that?
it's hookers.
of course not he doesn't have sex he makes love! [cameron can't help laughing]
still with us hank?
[to foreman] 10 units of insulin sub q an iv push (didn't catch it)-
[presses his stethoscope against hank's chest] damned if i know.
[glancing at the monitor] it's not steroids either.
first it's too high and now it's too low?
we can't stabilize his heart rate.
kayexalate.
it wouldn't do this.
no she's not gonna risk losing him. [he looks at her and chuckles]
n-no the monster trucks? house asking you that'sthat's funny.
yeah like a date! [oooh someone's jealous!]
courtesy of the generous sharon and the good folks at casting pharmaceuticals.
[laughing] oh god do we have to go to the lecture?
you think she's gonna prostitute herself? the three of us are that important to her?
cadmium poisoning.
i think i know how it happened.
i'm gonna need another urine sample.
[looks at him suspiciously] why wouldn't you give it to me before but now it's no problem?
so you've got nothing to lose this time. begs the question[walks over to hank] what were you worried about last time? [lola looks down at hank confused] the funny thing is when we tested you before we were just looking for steroids. [looking directly at hank] what should we look for now hank?
a little weed every now and then when no one was looking? [lola walks over to the window shocked]
you did. if you'd kept going you wouldn't have just lost your sense of smell.
based on the symptoms you're a lot more than a social user.
there must've been cadmium in the soil where the marijuana was grown. some people get bone loss kidney failure some people's testes shrink and some people lose their sense of smell. we'll start treating it right away. you should be fine by opening day. baseball's in the summer right?
if you've been clean the baby should be fine.
legionnaire's disease?
what if you're thinking about this backwards?
rickettsial. tick bites. nymphal ticks are out now they're bloodthirsty little bastards.
not always. and there's only one rash which fits.
gabe have you been camping recently? playing sports outside anything like that?
no hanging out anywhere new strange places?
okay this might be a bit delicate. we need to know if you're sexually active.
we've got to get another ct scan check his lungs again. [cameron looks confused.]
sorry medical personnel only.
we passed it actually. little tension in the room back there. thought you could use a break. your dad's a pretty high-powered guy.
hard to deal with sometimes?
listen i promise to keep my mouth shut but i need to know. you definitely haven't had any sexual contact of any kind?
[going to the vending machine] know what? girls like the cool guys now. you give it a few years they start liking the smart guys. you'll be all right.
i have to it's my job. [he hands gabe a candy bar and sits on the bench next to him.]
first name and last name? we've got a gabe upstairs. he's very old very sick.
my parents got split up too. every kid thinks like it's his fault it never is. so what about the rest of the stuff? any playing outside that your parents don't know about anything like that? maybe you were somewhere you weren't supposed to be?
gabe it's important.
he fell on something in the attic scraped his arm got the rash the next day. said it smelled really moldy up there.
i'm gonna get a sample. [he turns to leave but is blocked by an older gentleman in the doorway. chase looks rather surprised to see him. let's call the older man rowan for that is his name.]
sorry i've gotta go. [he hurries off.]
whoa whoa whoa! hold on guys i don't care that you're up here!
[putting on rubber gloves] doctor. i'm treating gabe reillich. he said he fell over near some pipes?
[putting on a mask] what here?
right any of you guys been feeling sick lately? rash cold anything? [he begins to collect samples of the dust.]
he fell on it. some weird kind of insulation. it's old house was built in the sixties.
felt. fibers are made of what cotton?
not as funny as you.
purile effusions.
well the mediastinum doesn't look right.
maybe he is cursed.
it's a naturally occurring bacteria. we believe it was in the insulation.
anthrax is very dangerous but we've caught it early. he's on levaquin it's the best antibiotic we have.
leishmaniasis doesn't cause pneumonia and filariasis 
all right hold still gabe. this is going to be a little uncomfortable. [chase looks down gabe's airway with a scope.]
two nodules in his throat.
we've got to intubate. ativan!
we're traching.
foreman! we're traching!
foreman you're not getting through!
betadine. [cuddy swabs gabe's neck with betadine.] i'm doing this. [he prepares to cut -- ]
we should try another antibiotic 
it's possible to think he's allergic to both anti 
the rash is classic anthrax.
necrosis can theoretically take as long as two weeks. [smirk.]
we don't know what causes it.
we have a world-renowned doctor consulting. he's convinced this is sarcoidosis.
stop! [he notices something on gabe's arm  the rash has turned black.]
necrosis.
right two incredibly rare diseases just happening to strike at once.
anthrax plus an allergic reaction.
fine. [he leaves.]
works for spaghetti. [foreman clears his throat.]
keep going. [house enters.]
no i don't need you.
wouldn't present this aggressively. [patient is trying to get chase's attention.]
what in a twelve-year-old male?
gabe's dad found leishmaniasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday. they didn't fit then but now they kind of do.
multiple neurofibromatosis.
the only reason you're thinking auto-immune is because you're a rheumatologist! if you were a proctologist you'd think rectal cancer.
you're messing with my head.
only because you made my dad part of my job.
pacific.
[on the stairs] it's probably a conference.
how would you feel if i interfered in your personal life?
i'm going to biopsy his skin lesions.
who extubated him?
feeling better gabe?
dr. chase can you and i have a word?
your diagnosis is wrong. no auto-immune disease. the swelling's probably just down because we've got him on steroids. it's masking whatever's wrong.
phospholipid antibodies are negative so no lupus. same for churg-strauss.
why are you here?
you were in new york last year for the scleroderma conference i didn't hear anything from you.
you said it you're still here.
i was 15 years old when you walked out. now you're walking back in?
[near tears] mum was living on gin and tonics how was i supposed to take care of her?
i know! she was yours.
i've got to talk to house about this treatment.
in spite of the cytoxan.
cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection. the anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.
you want a negative test for every auto-immune disease known to man? fine i'll get them!
the sle conference.
if we figure out exactly which auto-immune condition it is we can get you better quicker.
yeah.
not really.
we'll see. looks like you got your appetite back. that's a good sign. [gabe coughs.] want some water?
okay. [he gives gabe the water which drops out of gabe's hand.] whoops. it's all right. water's cheap.
what?
squeeze my fingers for me gabe? [gabe can't. chase tests the movement in his arm.]
he's getting worse. now his entire right hand and forearm are paralyzed.
i told you we should get him off the cytoxan. this is toxic neuropathy. we've been shoving drugs into his system for a disease he doesn't have!
you like my dad so much ask him out.
right thanks for the tip.
really don't push it.
then stay away. [looks at the scan] there's nothing there.
no masses no fibrous tangles nothing. it's not neurofibromatosis.
doesn't matter. his lesions are in the wrong place his feet are the one clear spot.
yeah and filariasis but the throat nodules still don't fit with that.
we've been through this it's not an allergy.
leprosy?
but the antibiotics we gave him they cure leprosy.
why does everybody need to know my business?
i'd tell you my dad left my mum drank herself to death you gonna care about me more?
i don't hate him. i loved him until i figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. you don't expect him to turn up to your football match? no disappointments. you don't expect a call on your birthday don't expect to see him for months? no disappointments. you want us to go make up? sink a few beers together nice family hug? i've given him enough hugs. he's given me enough disappointments.
that's it?
breathe. [gabe breathes.] breathe again. breathe again.
you had the antibiotics. you're not contagious any more.
leprosy is incredibly hard to catch. even your mum didn't get it. all right i want you to make a fist. [gabe does so slowly.]
it'll get back to normal in a month or two. your skin two or three weeks. you haven't asked about your dad.
he loves you.
yeah you do. [he sits on the bed next to gabe.] nothing you can do about it. he's your dad. it doesn't matter what he does you're gonna love him.
hey! [rowan turns to see chase walking up.] when's your flight? you got time for a drink?
i've got it.
not too long. next autumn i hope. i'll call you. well you're all set. [rowan offers his hand which chase takes.] i'll see you.
[coughs] a bit of a long shot.
true. the clot breaks off she could stroke and die. [looks at house questioningly]
i'm gonna have to ask you for the cell phone?
pretty sure my x-ray machine can take your phone in a fight. it'll fry it.
32.
she's a workaholic. okay carly hold still. the x-ray machine is gonna pass over your leg.
snowboarding in gstaad.
do you ski or board? you can come with if you like.
oh you want to have a drink with me? [she hits him.] oooh very aggressive! i like that. [the x-ray commences.]
get any read on the new chairman of the board?
there was no clot in her leg the angio was totally clean.
no neurogenic or myopathic abnormalities.
normal allison therefore no inflammation no immunologic response.
fifteen allison.
well let's go further outside the box. let's say the angio revealed a clot and let's say we treated that clot and now she's all better and personally thanked me by performing 
it was clean. [house puts the scans up on his light board.]
what are you talking about?
[gets up to look] that's impossible. it can't be the wrong 
i'll redo her angio straight away 
i can't believe i did that.
sorry to interrupt. we have a problem.
if i screw up the patient dies i'll never get another job.
well i like it here. [pause] you guys don't think it's weird house knew the patient needed a heart transplant before we did any heart tests?
but usually he's putting it in our face telling us how cleverly he figured it out. this time nothing. just i had a hunch.
[looking at the file] he had his stomach pumped! why would they do that?
huh. not the typical first guess.
metabolic causes. liver kidney diabetes 
are you expecting him to be weird?
you told him you liked him?
what are you talking about then?
why would you do that?
you like him like him?
hey he doesn't like anybody. and nobody likes him.
mri showed a subdural hematoma.
key word is slightly. as in not high enough to cause the coma. it's the subdural.
he's okay now he can leave.
because the brother doesn't want you to?
the hematoma caused the coma.
his liver's worse.
serology tests came back positive for hep-c.
coma vomiting abdominal pain hep-c explains everything.
he also has high estrogen levels in his blood. that's indicative of a chronic condition not acute.
uh-huh. and why is her test better than mine?
why wait to treat the hep-c? if i'm right joey gets better that much faster.
then what's the downside? or is that the downside.
the blood tests show you have hepatitis c. it's a virus that infects the liver.
well it's not all bad news. it can often be cured and even if not it's manageable.
usually it involves the exchange of bodily fluids the uh 
there are many ways the virus can be transmitted. sharing needles blood transfusions 
fine. i've no idea how he got it. but he has hepatitis-c. we're going to start him on interferon  [bill slaps chase across the face.]
joey. he obviously can't keep it.
that's different vogler's legit.
vogler doesn't set me up to have a mobster take a swing at me.
varices. you see it with chronic hep-c all the time.
what evil genius?
oh what? one of us?
all right look if it's not the hep-c then what's the problem? what's causing the liver failure?
about four hours.
what in two hours?
not really. we just take the blood out of joey's body and run it through a pig. [cgi shot of the process described by chase.] the pig's liver does what joey's can't cleans the blood which we send right back to him.
no just buys us some time to figure out what's poisoning your brother.
oh we've basically got a barn in the basement.
he's stable but comatose.
the hep-c. we never really treated it we stopped the interferon when it started poisoning his liver.
genetics. we don't just treat the virus we change it. a non-nucleoside allosteric inhibitor.
well what's the difference? he's dead without it.
we're going to put the medicine here. we don't want it to burn his veins when it goes in.
it's shown promise in testing.
he's not snapping out of this one he's not improving. you crossed out estrogen you've got an explanation?
and?
you think i'm the one running to vogler.
the feds checked for poisons we checked for poisons. i didn't do it.
an allergy then. did you hear me?
all of his food is strictly controlled. there's no correlation between his meals and his condition. he had steak and potatoes before the first coma and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one. you can trust me.
you can go in now sit with him if you want. [bill walks away.]
she's morbidly obese. the morbid part of that raises alarms.
doesn't take decades to kill yourself. if i was that fat i'd be pretty tempted to knock back a bottle of pills.
that's because of her depression.
insulin resistance?
why?
i'm suggesting it's a zero-sum game. your loss is my win. that's not conducive to team play.
the test involves some pretty precise measurements. if we don't know exactly how much you weigh we won't get the right answers. [foreman motions for chase to move over  he's got this one covered.]
obesity isn't something you just grow out of.
she's not a baby she's ten!
yeah if it gets her off the couch!
not from mummy.
no society tells you you have to be thin to be attractive. and guess what that's what attractive means: that society likes looking at you.
all right. you weigh 90 pounds because it makes you healthier?
increasing glucose to 6.9 milligrams per minute.
wanna put some money on it?
hey calm down!
we understand you're upset but 
a hypercoaguable state could cause a blood clot. blood clots can cause a heart attack.
no you're wrong. if the clot made it to the amygdala area of the brain it might cause uncontrollable rage.
she's fat!
extremely obese patients can get a fat embolus.
how do you know?
have you ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind? [cameron looks really pissed.]
[sarcastically] yeah she thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.
right so i guess it's the media and pharmaceutical companies' fault now? [he hands house a cup of coffee. house is puzzled at this gesture of sucking up.] not the fact that she can't stop shoving food down her throat. no one forced her to get fat.
give me a break it's not a disease.
yes i have. what i haven't seen lately is a kid eating an apple or riding a bike. you americans can't even compete with the rest of the world in basketball anymore unless of course it's the type you play with a remote control on a big screen tv.
could be something related to the pills.
i gave warfarin she gave heparin.
i was preparing my own dose.
you think you're incapable of making a mistake?
house isn't just going to protect you because you kiss his ass!
boss. [vogler leaves.] what was that about?
why have you been talking to cameron?
if he picks me?
i've been feeding you information so you'll protect me.
she's not gonna rat on house.
so what do you want to do?
it has to be. the sores presented right after we 
she's fat.
that's not what i meant.
no what if it's not a cause? what if it's a symptom?
pyoderma gangrenosum?
hypothyroidism?
yeah. 6'1.
no necrosis doesn't present in 
we'll have to do another ufc.
if we treat for cushing's and we're wrong she's dead.
go back to the pituitary views. she seemed okay.
i hope so. wait stop. there. [he points to a black spot on the mri.] what's that?
it's cushing's.
you look fantastic! [chase checking her out is a dirty man. bad chase.]
most likely just background nose.
what was what?
i get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.
you're making that up. that's vogler's company.
house never gives speeches. [house enters.]
you made a deal with vogler?
cancer? the senator's got aids.
why are we doing this here?
immunoglobulin deficiency?
another slightly enlarged node over here. two more in his neck and one in his groin.
what ending?
yeah.
well you don't have a choice. [chase walks off.]
and his spleen isn't enlarged.
you can't biopsy his spleen. it'll bleed like 
he should have all sorts of weird viruses.
cvid? that's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. i said that.
where is everybody?
no haven't heard from cameron all day. you seen house?
how come you're not in your office?
you think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here? he'll find you sooner or later.
preeclampsia. call the ob-gyn service and rub some prayer beads.
because she didn't carry long enough.
sure. [he leaves and foreman follows him out.]
i didn't do anything.
you wanted me to yell at him? [they walk out still talking.] what the hell would that have achieved? what is he going to jump into his time machine and fix everything?
dogs can learn things house can't.
child. [they both plaster smiles on their faces as they reach naomi's room and open the door.]
hi i'm dr. chase.
well ultrasound looks good. no sign of fetal distress.
well it still could be but it hasn't progressed at least. we're gonna put you on bed rest and monitor the baby.
we'll give you some potassium and magnesium as well. so we should keep the fluids running for now and check her again in an hour unless there are signs of fetal distress or  [naomi begins to choke.]
people choke it could be nothing. [foreman gets the piece of pear that was lodged in naomi's throat.] you all right?
don't see any signs of vasculitis. odd since you're always right about everything.
naomi you okay?
it's preterm labor.
fuse interbutoline then. we're going to give you some medicine okay? try to stop your labor.
she might make it to full term. contractions are less frequent and not well organized.
it's what i said. preeclampsia. a little stress from the mra she pops straight into labor.
come on she didn't seem that weak.
you think there's something obstructing her esophagus? [wilson enters.]
naomi can you open your mouth for me and tilt your head back? this is gonna be a little uncomfortable. [he inserts the scope into her throat and we see that there is a lump in her throat.] yeah there's swelling indenting the esophagus.
naomi is refusing to have the c-section. her odds aren't good enough.
she does this she knows she's gonna die.
you're saying she's making the right call?
she'd still have to wait a month. you can't take part in an trials until 30 days after major sugery.
you're scamming a doctor now? come on vogler's looking for any excuse to can you.
assuming the doctor running the trial isn't too pissed off to let her in yeah.
stats are dropping. down to the 80s. stay with us naomi.
we need you to leave the room. [cgi shot of a blood clot getting stuck in her lungs.]
we're trying to find out. [sean is escorted from the room. foreman is doing a quick ultrasound on the baby and naomi's lungs while chase looks down naomi's airway.]
flash pulmonary edema?
pulmonary embolus.
too risky. even if it dissolves the clot she could still bleed out anyway.
it's not good for the baby.
[inserting a needle] embolcine 250000 units. [the monitors start to beep.]
we don't have time. we've gotta suck it out.
i think so. she's stabilized.
ten minutes?
bp's dropping. up the dopamine. she's not responding. how much?
is she septic? [house lifts the robe on her stomach to reveal a expanding purplish bruise.]
no respiration.
they aren't mature. [chase and foreman work on the baby.]
[rubbing the baby's chest] come on come on.
come on open up.
he's still not breathing; we've got to intubate. [he goes to get the equipment.]
yellow form to the second form you're gonna be fine.
it's treatable as long as you go to the second floor. next.
you're going to need a ct scan. second floor take the elevators follow the parade. next! [house whistles to him from the doorway. chase goes to.]
maybe something systemic.
i'll get on her bloodwork.
the list is like two miles long!
a.
it's no problem.
the vials showed blood in your gi tract. we need to find out where it's coming from. you won't feel it. i'm going to numb the back of your throat and dr. foreman is going to give you a sedative. open. [mary opens her mouth and chase sprays her throat. the three of them are gathering a crowd of spectators.] swallow. now lay on your side for me. and here we go. [chase rolls his eyes at the people crowding him.] yell fire or something.
all right. try to relax mary this shouldn't take too long. [he inserts the scope and he and foreman watch it's progress on the monitor.]
all right i'm in her stomach. there's no bleeding.
30 feet of digestive tract it could be anywhere in there. we're not going to see it with this.
believe it or not this is a camera. you swallow it and it goes all the way through your system. the antennae pick up the signal from the pill. [mary is wearing a belt with the sensor equipment.] we're going to look at the video of your intestines see where the blood is coming from and fix it. water? down the hatch. [she swallows it.]
he asked for help!
there? a dieulafoy?
no.
the lp and blood smear showed no signs of infection. [hands a blue slip to a patient] here. take these two pills and you can go. [house sniffs the hair of his patient.]
neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.
we should get back out there. cuddy's going to be looking for us.
and it's getting worse.
could be barbiturate withdrawal.
rat poison. could also cause the neck pain.
when i was in med school i had this old professor 
before the ct scan was introduced he specialized in transcranial ultrasound.
it was my idea!
no poisons. did a tox screen on her blood urine and hair nothing. did em twice.
no toxins no tumor no bone cancer.
no family history and no blood in her urine or
you want to do a differential based on symptoms that might happen?
she's 12.
she travels a lot.
what?
maybe she's adopted and we've got the wrong history.
could explain the rash and muscle pain but not the bleeding or seizures.
think she's allergic to polyester?
then what are you thinking? what do the balloons mean?
they're avoiding her.
no red blood cells were intact.
blood looks like it's been put through the blender now. [house enters.]
thrombocytopenia purpura?
oh god.
you're doing good.
you should be your platelet count's up.
[walking up] plasmapheresis is working she's going to be fine.
[playing with a small ball] so the bear wipes himself with the rabbit. [he throws the ball to foreman.]
hey!
what are you doing here? [foreman gives cameron a hug aww.]
what here in this office?
then why'd you do it?
the jaw tells us why he stroked?
[as soon as the three of them are in the hallway] what perks?
he's so he's so old!
cameron's got the emg first. who's that?
that's what she called herself?
could also be an aneurysm due to trauma.
i noticed a small bruit when i listened to harvey's left carotid. you could hear that if you had an aneurysm from trauma.
no not necessarily.
the guy obviously broke his jaw somehow. who knows what other trauma he's suffered? we should do the angiogram again.
wow. yeah i get it. house is adorable. i just want to hold him and never let go. [they open harvey's door to find annette strangling him. (and yes the blinds were shut so they couldn't see walking up.)]
foreman stop. let her go.
she's she's a dominatrix. [foreman's eyebrows almost lift off his head.] right annette?
it was a long time ago. i was seeing this woman. a banker and turns out she liked to be burned.
it was a weird scene. i observed  [house enters.]
i met her at some parties yeah.
i said i thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.
i'm not into 
then we should schedule him for vascular surgery. go into the carotids find the aneurysm repair it.
harvey you're lucky she wasn't arrested. what were you thinking doing that at a hospital? [he holds out his hands.] squeeze my fingers?
i need you to squeeze with both hands.
weakness in his right arm and hand. harvey's having mini-strokes; the blood thinners aren't making a difference.
the surgery will repair the damaged blood vessels in your neck and your strokes will stop.
more like strangulations.
harvey calm down.
you can do this on your own. surgery's the only 
harvey you don't need 
[in a commanding-ish tone] harvey you will do what i say.
sign the consent. sign it!
i already did. mashed them up in his applesauce it'll lighten him up soon enough.
and i already tried.
annette's barred from the hospital.
he's crashing. can we get a cart in here?
they guy lives in market town. i don't know if he grew there but we could check the local funeral home.
or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.
[going through a closet] permanent home address? emergency contacts?
[finding collars and a slew of tic-tacs in the closet] mistress annette. you have to extort a date out of house. you think that's a bad sign? cameron?
house isn't going to hand you anything. you want him you've gotta take him. jump him.
yes harvey park. [pause] great we've been looking for you! i'm calling from the princeton-plainsboro teaching hospital. harvey's here and it's rather he hung up.
i didn't get a chance.
harvey's doing fine so far. how'd the night go?
which means we've got no idea what's causing the strokes.
oh i got them at harvey's. what i just took two boxes; the guy's got a whole drawer of them!
well there's lots of interesting stuff at his place. the mints weren't high up on the list.
if you're trying to humiliate me i told you 
ugh.
uh. smells like old vomit.
and an infection of the jaw isn't likely to show up on blood tests.
shouldn't we wait for the humane society or something?
[on his cell] yeah timber rattlesnake.
maybe the snake wrangler was wrong about the type he caught.
her calcium up?
parathyroid adenoma.
hyperthyroid.
already tried it.
the guy risked his life to save this thing?
i think i've got a better grip here you go for the mouth. [he holds out a fist.] all right i'm odds.
come on.
i don't care if he's scratching your nads off don't let go.
i say we let the guy die.
what about drugs? his tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.
kitchen sink?
tremors in the muscle fiber.
they live in short hills two hours away.
[carrying a mat] he switched to yoga. brand new yoga mat and tape.
or it might indicate back pain.
yoga's good for picking up the ladies too.
whoa. [hands a bottle full of pills to foreman] in a desk drawer hidden in the back under some papers. secret stash.
amphetamines.
uh yeah he switched from mountain biking to yoga could have been indication 
but he's experiencing significant paresthesias and he can't move his hands or toes.
but without the antibodies we can't even test for it. we don't know if we're right.
he said he went to paris and the pet confirms it so what?
but there are other symptoms of aip.
light sensitivity?
and there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.
[checking mark's vitals] if he had aip it should have already happened.
two milligrams of ativan!
he needs ativan!
catheter's out there's no way to collect the sample
you think another light's gonna make the difference?
