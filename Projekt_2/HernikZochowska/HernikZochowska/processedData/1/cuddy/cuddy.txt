i was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.
you think we have nothing to talk about?
i sign your paychecks.
that would be juvenile.
i can still fire you if you're not doing your job.
your billings are practically nonexistent.
you ignore requests for consults.
you're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.
6 years times 3 weeks; you owe me better than 4 months.
to what?
look dr. house the only reason that i don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.
your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. the clinic is part of your job. i want you to do your job.
yes why are you yelling?
you also can't make long distance phone calls.
or photocopies; you're still yelling.
i assume those are two separate points.
is your yelling designed to scare me because i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be scared of. more yelling? that's not scary. that you're gonna hurt me? that's scary but i'm pretty sure i can outrun ya.
oh i looked into that philosopher you quoted jagger and you're right you can't always get what you want but as it turns out if you try sometimes you get what you need.
i need you to do your job.
no tv but we've got patients.
i made sure your first case was an interesting one.
patient admitted complaining of back spasms.
patient is orange.
no the fruit.
i mean orange.
exam room 1.
why are you giving adler steroids?
you don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. at least we don't since tuskeegee and mengele.
i'm stopping the treatment.
it's my hospital.
with no proof.
you don't have any evidence. and nobody knows anything huh? then how is it that you always assume you're right?
because i'm a doctor. because when we make mistakes people die.
no. don't eat too much too fast.
right.
you got lucky.
i told you not to listen to him he's an idiot.
i don't want to know what you found out.
i'm your doctor you've been good to me and good to this hospital of course i care but i don't see how this conversation can end well for me. either your wife is having an affair or she's not having an affair and you have come here because you rightly think i should fire him but i can't even if it cost me your money the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have.
what are you doing back here? patient?
how's your hooker doing?
i heard you found her on the roof.
you notify the parents?
and is there a paternity bet on the father of the patient?
i saw the parents in the lobby smart money is obviously on the father.
fine. you tell your guy if i win you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.
my guy will call your guy.
it's not a good idea to move your son in his condition.
perfect.
how did you find out about this?
you can't do that!
sounds reasonable. well if you want to transfer your boy that is your choice but i still think it's the wrong [interrupted]
you can't order a $3200 dna test to win a bet.
i'm serious.
insurance is not going to pay for a bet.
fine. i will let you out of clinic duty for one week after you pay the $3200 for the pcr test.
whoo.
you're half an hour late.
one case is not a load.
[looks at his leg] no you couldn't.
short sweet.< grab a file.
jodi matthews?< [jodi stands.]< please accompany dr. house to exam room 1.
hi.< i'm dr. cuddy.< nice to meet you.
say ah.
he has a sore throat.
i was in a board meeting.
wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there was any doubt about its efficacy huh?
go home.< drink some hot tea. [she leaves.]
the one with the pulled muscle.
you are not getting out of clinic duty.
no i don't but working with people actually makes you a better doctor.
when did i give you the impression that i care? [pause]
it's not going to work. you know why?< because this is fun.< you think of something to make me miserable i think of something to make you miserable: it's a game!< and i'm going to win because i got a head start. you are already miserable. [cuddy leaves her office and runs into wilson.]
is this important?
no. [she leaves as house exits her office.]
and you're the only one who put this together because?
because you're better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.
which is exactly what you're doing. you're finding a cluster because you think it's interesting to find a cluster. two plain old sick babies would bore you.
[smiling] shrink. if you would consider going to a shrink i would pay for it myself. the hospital would hold a bake sale for god's sake.
[slowly] two sick babies is very sad but it doesn't prove an epidemic. [she leaves. house is left alone in her office.]
excuse me! hi. intake sent you up here?
yeah intake messed up. i'm very very sorry. nurse alpret will arrange for an ambulance to take you to princeton general. [starts to wheel the pregnant woman back to the elevator]
the maternity ward is temporarily closed.
yes i am very sorry. [elevator opens house comes out]
you'll be there very very soon. [elevator door closes next line to house] happy now?
how bad?
where did this come from?
well there's gotta be something in common.
i'm putting a team together. we're going to start swabbing. [she leaves.]
well we're checking the vents it could be airborne. somebody get the sinks too and underneath them.
oh what else are they going to do? it's not like they're delivering babies.
ah yeah. about half the antibacterial gel dispensers are empty or broken.
well if the staff can't wash their hands it's no wonder an infection has spread. [while they're talking we see med student's tie has been hanging in the sink and generally being a nuisance.] hey tie clip!
we have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a petri dish. put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.
so you're going to flip a coin? that's how you decide which baby lives?
you can't experiment on babies.
on adults. with their consent.
[sighing; to house] do what you think is best. [house leaves; cuddy looks very unhappy about the whole situation.]
no just some baby formula being stored under a sink with a dripping faucet.
i was. i wasted a couple of hours chasing it down but of course the formula hasn't been anywhere near the babies.
whatever idiot stored them there <U+0096>
i am calm. [she walks over to med student with tie and takes scissors to him leaving him med student without tie.]
i warned you. [to wilson] i did that calmly. [she and wilson walk into nicu as chase walks out. karen is looking in the windows.]
there's only been two reported cases of it ever in the united states.
cross out the herpes viruses.
influenza a.
no the lindpert boy had a bit of jaundice. he should be checking out today.
why?
i'll just tell his parents he can't check out because he has the smallpox.
what are you eight?
you better stop or it'll stick that way. you have a patient in exam room 1.
she's been waiting for you since eleven. [cuddy walks off.]
you diagnosed the patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine she went into respiratory distress and you injected her with epinephrine. presumably 1 cc.
people don't go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.
it's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart.
the drawer has syringes with both dosages you could have easily reached for the wrong one.
everyone makes mistakes. this is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance.
and the discipline board? are they gonna whack your hand too?
what choice do i have?
i can justify keeping her here for 24-hour observation. if you haven't found an underlying cause for the cardiac arrest by then i will have to notify our attorneys. [house looks at his watch and walks out.]
ooh i know! prednisone compromises the immune system. isn't that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn't have?
are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?
you're gonna admit negligence?
[on the phone] i have an opening thursday at three. do you have a fourth? is he any good? [someone walks into her office.] can i call you right back? okay. [she hangs up.] what's up? [we see that it's foreman that walked into her office.]
mixed connective tissue disease? her ana is barely elevated!
0-2 stat is down to 83 pulmonary problems breathing problems <U+0096>
she comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest.
maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone!
there's always an explanation isn't there?
but never one involving you screwing up.
i am going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do for another. i am going to stop you from killing your patient. you're off the case.
we're going to treat the symptoms.
there is no underlying condition. what's her status?
pneumonitis from the hyperbaric chamber. put her on 40% oxygen until her 0-2 stats increase.
could be from the hypertensive episode. let's follow them with labs.
order a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory.
i don't need to hear what dr. house was considering! all of this woman's symptoms can be traced to dr. house's considerations. okay. let's just get this patient healthy. i want her going out the front door and not the back.
any change with medication?
like what?
specifically?
specifically?
you're just saying you think house is right.
of course he might be right! it might be the hand of god at work. don't say it's something else unless you've got something concrete to offer. [a teabag is thrown onto cuddy's paperwork she picks it up and stares at the entering house.] what's this hemlock?
sister augustine <U+0096>
you did good with the nun. congratulations.
merry christmas dr. house. dr. wilson. [she leaves.]
good morning dr. house!
yeah and your big cane is real subtle too.
the clinic can wait.
you should know by now my doctors have no secrets from me.
it doesn't matter who. the point is i know exactly what you did.
[ walking over to him ] somebody knows about a bad thing you did <U+0096> that's a big field. but somebody you think might have told me that narrows it down quite a bit. someone who views me as a maternal authority figure. a young person perhaps how am i doing? you think i'm gonna get there? presumably hospital business. how many patients
actually i was just gonna remind you you owe me six clinic hours this week.
hi this is dr. cuddy. i need all the charts on dr. house's current patients. [ throws birthday card in wastebasket ]
i need to speak with you. now.
yesterday your patient's tumor was 5.8 centimeters. today it's 4.6. how did that happen?
you also requisitioned 20cc of ethanol -- what patient was that for? or are you planning a party?
you shrunk the tumor!
fraud! fraud was the only way. there is a reason that we have these guidelines.
bergen has a right to know what he is operating on.
it takes two department heads to treat shortness of breath? what do the complications increase exponentially with cup size?
you're ordering tests to cover your lechery. interesting.
[enters] hi boys. mrs. campbell's test results. [they keep their faces blank] oh you remember her the preschool teacher with the heart of silicon.
they came in yesterday i figured you guys would have been all over them. i know how concerned you are.
the tests were normal. course that's just my opinion you may want to call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.
what's wrong? they look normal to me.
waiting downstairs why?
maternal instinct is always irrational. that doesn't mean it's wrong.
it doesn't mean she's mentally incompetent
that's a brilliant legal argument.
her only sign of mental illness is that she disagrees with you. some would consider that a sign of sanity.
get the mother to sign off that she's refusing this treatment.
john henry giles you a fan of his music?
forget his paralysis.
as far as this hospital is concerned this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia. boring.
marty hamilton is his primary physician out in california. he's dealing with the paralysis.
dr. hamilton already called and asked for your team. and by team i don't mean you.
foreman did his residency with hamilton.
he wants someone he can trust.
someone who will stick to the pneumonia. john henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.
it's foreman's case. [she walks away.]
[to patients] excuse me.
why the yelling?
it's right over the clinic. very cute.
you need a lawyer?
when i hired you i knew you were insane. i will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things but once they're done. trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is in itself insane so when i hired you i also set aside $50000 a year for legal expenses. so far you've come in under budget.
dr. foreman called dr. hamilton. he's flying in from l.a.
dr. hamilton is flying in as a friend of john henry's to pull the plug. [pause]
she's just about prepped for her mri? mrs. whitney?
[enters] you tried to steal someone else's test?
[grabs letter opener from house] i can't believe you authorized this.
she can't have an mri. the ct scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm the mri magnet would have ripped it out of her body. you like the alien movies? you had no medical history what were you thinking?
she has an electrolyte imbalance.
fine. but nothing more until you find out who she is.
did you find a brain tumor on her mri?
right. [stops at clinic waiting room] shelley diamond?
dr. house is ready to see you now. [hands house the file]
oh yeah. just walk out like i'm not going to do anything.
[walks up with two college-age girls wearing lab coats] dr. house.
since you're too sick to work in the clinic <U+0096>
<U+0096> i thought you <U+0096>
- i thought you could do some teaching. patient histories.
when you teach you learn so much don't you think?
[interrupts] it doesn't matter! bacterial meningitis highly contagious if she is out of the hospital we are so liable.
you are a doctor; do what doctors do. pick up the phone dial 911 and a cop on the other end does what cops do and finds the missing person! [house raises eyebrows foreman takes off coat] i assume the rest of you have doctor things to do <U+0096> [looks at house] i know you do.
this is dr. cuddy what's going on?
it's gonna be an hour.
if you can't wait one hour to get your<U+0096>
kid? how old? [takes chart]
this is impossible. a 16-year-old doesn't get hemolytic anemia <U+0096>
elevated indirect bilirubin low serum haptoglobin
[looks at chart] uh no.
you know there are other ways to manage pain.
you're addicted.
you're in denial.
it's not just your leg. you wanna get high! you're doing what 80 mg a day?
it's double what you were taking when i hired you.
i can't always be here to protect you. patients talk. doctors talk. [elevator doors open]
you can't go a week without your drugs.
no you can't. if you're just getting off pain medication it will hurt you won't be having a great time but you'll make it. if you're detoxing you'll have chills nausea your pain will magnify five ten times. you won't make it.
i'll give you a week off clinic duty if you can go a week off narcotics.
you love the pills. two weeks.
a month. [a pause. house reaches into his pocket and pulls out his vicodin.]
why did you tell cameron to lie to mr. foster?
answer me.
so that was you just saying nothing.
the guy is furious.
so what are you going to do? the father's insisting on the lupus treatment.
well you can't just sit back and let the kid die.
so that's your plan? you're gonna play chicken with the kid's life?
take the week off.
he's not stable enough he'd never make it through the door!
there are over 15000 patients on the transplant list.
in jersey? i'd say uh twenty. 2000 patients die each year because a donor liver can't be found that's almost five a day.
i'll see what i can do.
out of the way! [on her cell phone] we have the liver. prep or 4.
you wanna explain to me why you stopped the surgery? [keith's dad beyond words punches house in the jaw who then falls to the ground.] n <U+0096> oh my god! my god. [foreman and chase run to restrain the dad cameron and cuddy kneel to look at house.]
that liver is going to somebody right now.
father of three.
how'd it go?
well admitting you have a problem is the first <U+0096>
what are you going to do?
better hope he never finds out that that was your idea.
it's 4:45.
carol moffett please see dr. house in exam room 1. [woman gets to her feet with difficulty.]
maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters-
you put him on lupron.
and you told them it was like milk.
is there any way in which that is not a lie?
good ones?
your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don't make a right.
second reason.
and if he told you the truth what would this stuff do to him?
third reason.
excellent! [walks over to her desk] you and your lawyer can write a paper.
i thought you said there were only three. [sits down]
seriously?
because his lawyer is a nice guy who realizes it's unfair to blame us for ruining this kid's hundred million-dollar career.
you want me to put hank wiggen on the transplant list.
well they like to save them for people who have-how do i put this- kidney problems.
that's a great idea we can be the hospital that killed two people. the guy who deserved the kidney and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren't even sure what was wrong with him.
the test for addison's was inconclusive.
why do we do it at all? we should just ask you. [tries to take a paper from under house's fist; he doesn't budge. she gives him an irritated look.]
your powers of deduction are breathtaking.
it's what i live for. once in a while though try to ruin my day. ask me something i can say yes to. [house leaves]
how'd the ballplayer doing?
too bad about his career.
major league baseball's collective bargaining agreement requires medical reports on all treatment. given hank's history he's not likely to get much leniency. [stops outside of her office]
[suspiciously] you're not treating him for addison's!
you're lying on the report?!
[hesitantly] no it shouldn't but it usually does. [a smile crosses her face] on the other hand it means someone can actually beat the yankees. [enters her office and house leaves]
male spiking fever congested chest and coughing up green sputum pain in breathing <U+0096>
but his x-ray and ct scan show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.
no infiltrate! just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.
he's not responding to cefuroxime his pulsox is dropping much faster than it should for pneumonia and plus he's got an odd little rash.
on his arm. papular lesion one centimeter on top of a long thin scab.
fine.
no! admit it i got you with the rash.
jeff you've helped our hospital a lot. i wouldn't have assigned dr. house to your case if i didn't have every confidence in <U+0096>
where'd you hear about those?
well those are very rare conditions.
i wouldn't expect anything else. [as jeffrey walks off] everyone's a doctor. [beeping is heard all heads in the lobby turn toward gabe's room.]
it means his airway's closing up. [she pushes jeffrey and sarah away from the bed.]
we've got you it's okay.
airway's inhibited?
pushing 3 ccs. [they move the bed out and foreman prepares to intubate gabe.]
his lips are cyanotic
he's not getting air. oh we have to trach him right now.
he's okay. [sarah gives jeffrey a hug.]
it's rare for an individual to make a donation significant enough to impact an organization as large and unwieldy as a hospital. this donation does come with one string: that he be made chairman of the board. i think that's a reasonable request. [shot of wilson who is on the board? whoa.] i think he should have the right to know what it is we do with his $100 million. please welcome our new chairman of the board edward vogler. [all the board members clap vogler stands.]
what you want to put more vending machines in the hallway? maybe a roulette wheel?
that's uh just one of our doctors.
he's different.
no not exactly.
it's just a coat. he's very good.
i need you to wear your lab coat.
wear the coat.
guy gives $100 million to cure cancer pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.
you know that's not what he's doing.
oh shame on him! saving lives like that!
clinical trials save thousands of lives.
pharmaceutical companies do that every day.
who the hell am i talking to? suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?
so if you ignore ethics to save one person it's admirable but if you do it to save a thousand you're a bastard. all he's done is taken your game and gone pro.
it took him three seconds to size you up and surprise? he doesn't like you. wear the damn coat.
come in.
that's dr. house's department. they deal with cases that other doctors can't figure out.
he saves one patient per week.
uh maybe not but <U+0096>
[a bit shocked] what? no.
that's an incredibly inappropriate question.
i respect him that is all you need to know.
well i told him <U+0096>
uh dr. house i'm confused by your time and date stamps. it appears that you put carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.
you don't have hunches. you know.
is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?
what about any other criteria?
are there any <U+0096>
substance abuse? any history of <U+0096>
any psychiatric conditions history of depression <U+0096>
dr. house if you subvert or mislead this committee you will be subject to disciplinary action. [pause]
i simply want you to answer the question! is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria that would disqualify your patient from getting a heart?
don't have it.
nope.
house has been very busy.
we're in a meeting.
you have three choices: hire a lawyer to fight the order treat the guy or go to jail for contempt. up to you.
so does ophthalmology. who cares this is a hospital. you can't just cut a department!
i am the only one that can control him. [house barges in again.]
dr. house from what i understand your <U+0096>
okay what?
he really cares about his patients.
house has some directed donations foundation support [leafing through folder] it's around here
he can change he's <U+0096>
yes i hate him and here i am desperately trying to protect his job. what does that tell you?
i do not protect people i like. i protect people who are assets to this hospital.
right. there are three female chiefs of medicine at major hospitals in this country and we all got there using our feminine wiles.
i don't like him!
i don't get along with him!
[to house] i see you've found out what we're meeting about.
well whatever the reason the coat looks good on you. [looks at the chart] chai hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure no way!
what interferon?
what hep-c?
is hiding a mobster's hep-c that important?
you know you are a piece of work even now.
vogler wants to fire you. lose the whole department.
he threatened to fire me. [she sits.]
i told him i know where the bodies are buried the stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. told him he can't ditch me.
i'll deal with that then.
yes. but some things are going to change.
um no but i know a few people on whom i'd like to see it happen. we need to talk.
we're not talking.
no you're attempting to avoid talking because you know what i want to talk about.
you need to get rid of one of your people.
there's no way out on this. you may as well get it over with as fast as you can like ripping off a band-aid.
like you care.
you have a week. get it done. [cameron gets out of the elevator. house goes into the elevator cameron sighs and follows.]
he asked for time to complete performance reviews on everyone in his department.
a week. he'll do it. [cameron starts to walk up.]
you looking for info? thought you already had house all figured out?
[to vogler] the mris are rented but did you make a decision?
all right if you can <U+0096>
if he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money what difference does it make?
it's been a week.
who is it?
in my office.
you're not doing a brain biopsy on a spot on a mri.
not on an united states senator.
a brain biopsy can cause permanent neurological damage.
no it's not.
it's not my call either.
it's up to you.
or it could be nothing. reading brain mris is not an exact science.
it could be a transient ischemic attack. you could make the argument for watching carefully for the time being.
that's absurd and insulting.
so you biopsied his brain for nothing.
the antiretrovirals aren't working.
he's just going to keep getting worse. you realize that right?
why are you giving that speech next week? [house pushes the elevator button.] we're both just doing what we have to do.
checking in on a patient? yeah wow how do i look myself in the mirror?
it's a ten minute speech!
vogler's drug works!
oh why do you have to make everything so dramatic? [elevator dings.]
lymphoma?
i just follow the scent of arrogance. [house makes a face.]
doesn't matter. once you find em you've gotta check em.
in the senator's condition a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!
yeah.
what did he do grease your cane?
he didn't i did. the nurses were concerned and they called me. there was evidence of abuse; you took a big legal risk by not calling social services.
oh well that's certainly a relief.
you made the wrong one.
sure. no idea who that is.
i was protecting you.
and vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.
vogler's just one vote; he's gotta convince the other eleven of us. i'm just trying to stop you from making that extra easy. [house leaves.]
you shouldn't personalize this.
you gave us that money for a reason. are you really willing to throw it all away because of one doctor?
we need time.
it's not cancer.
it's hemorrhoids.
looks worse than it is. [house walks in.]
can this wait?
what did you think would happen when you made that speech? you think he would just pout for a little while and we'd all forgive you? you don't spit on the man who signs your paycheck. first cameron then wilson <U+0096> you're next. [to patient] pull your pants up.
of course it's about the money. the money vogler gave he could have bought a few jets maybe a baseball team or just stuck it in chase manhattan and collected interest. but he gave it to us to buy equipment to do research! you are a great doctor house but you are not worth $100 million.
[to person she was walking with] thank you. [to house] i'm late for the board meeting. [house gets up to walk with her.]
i don't want to hear it.
the pregnant woman? she wasn't qualified for that trial and i'm not going to apologize <U+0096>
her thymus gland <U+0096>
this is why she couldn't gain weight.
i'll call the police and social services and have all the charges withdrawn.
you're not going to do it?
i can't do it.
i'm not abstaining i'm voting no.
he did his job.
maybe.
it's what we do.
but that's not the choice you're giving us.
and you're not accountable to anybody either! because you think you own us.
if you think house deserves to go if you think i deserve to go wilson deserved to go then vote yes. but if you're doing this because you are afraid of losing his money then he's right! he does own you. [she stands to leave.] you have a choice. maybe the last real one you'll have here. [she leaves. everyone looks at vogler and]
what are you doing?
well to the great champion. saved you saved wilson saved the whole team. [she drinks the entire glass in one go.] of course none of them would have needed saving if you could actually get along with another human being.
well you only cost us $100 million. could have saved some lives could have made a few jobs helped a few people. yippee.
the lesser of two evils. you should be mourning. i know i am.
[leaving the clinic and heading toward him] dr. house! we need you here.
a judge at the campus pool center collapsed lp revealed a virulent form of bacterial meningitis.
2500 people at the pool center were exposed. they're being bused to all the neighboring hospitals.
joe! [a security guard <U+0096> joe probably <U+0096> stops house from leaving.] dr. house doesn't have a blue slip. no one leaves the quarantine area without a blue slip. you are a doctor at this hospital: act like one. and [she grabs a cup of pills] take these. [house does so.]
you guys figure we're done down there? the 800 people milling around are just waiting for the bathroom?
it's the definition of meningitis!
oh side to side.
the three of you lobby now.
you just don't want to deal with the epidemic.
you have one hour. [she stalks off.]
you in the lobby now.
you had your hour. three actually.
she'll wait. two more buses just arrived. we need you downstairs.
that's true. i wonder if that has anything to do you with you costing us $100 million.
good coffee? [having stopped the show here i'd like to point out that right here both house and wilson are staring at cuddy's cleavage. bwah.] the rest of this hospital is busting it's tail and [house raises the chart he's holding to cover cuddy's midsection.] what are you doing?
i am working it got hot stop acting like a 13-year-old!
oh women can't be heads of hospitals? or just ugly ones?
your 3 o'clock interview for dr. cameron's position is in your office.
no you won't. you will interview this person and if he can put two sentences together you will send him to the lobby where he will do his job. unlike the two of you.
[to a nurse working on a patient] he's a little dehydrated put him on a saline drip and give him some orange juice. [house walks up.]
oh well given the current crisis i'm tempted to say no but since you've been so sweet to me today <U+0096>
how fast can you have her prepped?
you'll have a surgeon in the room in 10.
eh.. um he pays you for this?
we're not done here we have to talk!
dr. house.
i heard about dr. cameron's conditions for coming back to work.
well i think it's a good thing. what happened in your last relationship it's no reason to wall yourself from people forever. 5 years of self-pity is probably enough.
well <U+0096>
bear in mind cameron's probably the only female that can tolerate you. wear the sky-blue shirt. it almost makes you look nice.
the kid's in a coma he needs the surgery!
you lied to them!
harvey's your son. i'm sure you still care about him.
dr. riley is throwing up; he obviously can't lecture
[laughing] dr. riley doesn't have a history of lying to me.
i'll give you two hours off clinic duty.
you'll do it.
because the world hates you. or because it's a class on diagnostics. pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better.
hmm and you were supposed to keep on walking. sorry i guess we both screwed up. go on do it again.
two. i know you'd rather spend a couple of hours listening to yourself than listening to patients. class starts in twenty minutes. [house leaves into the lobby of the clinic.]
the mri revealed a problem.
i'm sorry none of your doctors found it earlier; i'm personally going to oversee your treatment from now on.
we may need to remove the leg.
we have to do the surgery. the necrotic tissue has to be removed. if there's too much <U+0096>
it may become necessary in order to save your life.
amazing advances have been made. kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.
amputation is safer.
the blockage of blood flow <U+0096>
yes. it caused muscle cell death. when those cells die they release cytokines and potassium --
the post-operative pain alone <U+0096>
it depends on how much muscle cell death there was. he could be right he could come out of this with almost full use of his leg.
he could be in pain for the rest of his life. there's a third option surgically. a middle ground between what we did and amputation.
yeah.
who diagnosed <U+0096>
paddles! charge.
he's back.
he change his mind?
we can do that.
we'll obviously monitor his condition closely and if he can get through the next forty-eight hours without another cardiac incident <U+0096>
you should talk to him about what he wants to do.
you'll be out in less than a minute.
we go in take out the dead muscle. there's still some risk of reperfusion injury but <U+0096>
you're saving his life.
[at the doorway] twenty minutes ago.
i want to run something by you.
stacy's husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital. and since we can definitely use her back here i've offered her a job. general counsel.
she said only if it was okay with you. [house starts to walk off as the rolling stones' you can't always get what you want plays ironically in the background.] yes or no?
