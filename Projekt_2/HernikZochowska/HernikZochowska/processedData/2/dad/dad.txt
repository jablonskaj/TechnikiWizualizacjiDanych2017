[doesn't look amused] you know what your problem is greg?
you just don't know how lucky you are.
where's the head?
oh crap it's in the car. i'll go get it.

[makes a noise as he suddenly realizes that house lied to him.]
it's montana.
all right you don't need me for this.
i have cirrhosis.
no look you're not touching me.
[to kalvin.] you err never expressed a shred of regret for what happened to your mother.
if you'd have worn a damn rubber you'd have been fine; could have saved her life. you wouldn't be lying here!
look if he doesn't give a damn then neither do i!
you know you don't know a thing about my suzanne.

(he hands her his glass of champagne.) the doctor gave me these for anxiety all right. it'll calm you down. here. come on its okay. (he hands her a pill.)

any idea what's wrong with her?
look i know some models are notorious for hissy fits but alex i've never even seen her get angry. even when she was a kid she was--
she only had one sip of champagne. (house rolls his eyes.)
all right look i gave her a valium. you think that's what did this?
no.
well how much worse?
so either way i'm i'm risking her life. do you have to tell her how dangerous it is?
nurse! nurse!

how could you possibly think?
you son of a--
that is my daughter you're talking about.
i'm her manager i have to promote her.
all right. (he starts to leave.)
i never touched her.
what are you doing? trying to trap me into saying--

doctor maybe you and i should talk about this first.
i just think alex doesn't need to be overwhelmed right now.
what did the biopsy tell you?
this is unbelievable. you did it. you fixed her.
she has cancer.
so its not cancer?
she's not a guy.
this is obviously a joke this is impossible.
son!
god's presence often descends on boyd to help him guide others.
since he was 10.
what does that mean?
yes.
few times an hour he likes to stay hydrated. you think germs might have gotten in?
you said benign.
you're talking brain surgery?
hallucinations?
this is the way that the lord often is with his chosen ones. he... he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.
excuse me... may i talk to you?
umm... boyd's getting dressed he's ready to check out.
i told him he said that god said it was ok. he was fine. could you talk to him?
i'm sorry; you don't even know what's wrong with him. god knows the answer and i would rather leave it in his hands than yours.
what's he doing? what's going on?
herpes... that's something you get from sex right?
boyd... is he right?
son.
i have faith in the lord. you i trust; as much as you can trust a teenage boy. take off your clothes.
