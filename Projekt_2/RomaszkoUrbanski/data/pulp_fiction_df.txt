1$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.
2$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.
3$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but –
4$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$– but you forget about it in a day or two -
5$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$– yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.
6$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?
7$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.
8$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$You sound like a duck. Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...
9$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.
10$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$After tonight.
11$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
12$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$WAITRESS$Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
13$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Oh yes, thank you.
14$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I'm doin' fine.
15$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."
16$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Did it work?
17$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.
18$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Did they hurt the little girl?
19$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I don't know. There probably never was a little girl – the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.
20$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$You wanna rob banks?
21$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.
22$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$So you don't want to be a bank robber?
23$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.
24$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$And no more liquor stores?
25$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.
26$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$I'm not gonna kill anybody.
27$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.
28$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Well, what else is there, day jobs?
29$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Not this life.
30$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Well what then?
31$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Garcon! Coffee!
32$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$This place.
33$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$WAITRESS$"Garcon" means boy.
34$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Here? It's a coffee shop.
35$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.
36$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.
37$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.
38$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?
39$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Yeah.
40$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.
41$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Uh-huh.
42$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$That was a good idea.
43$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Thanks.
44$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$We made more from the wallets then we did the register.
45$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Yes we did.
46$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$A lot of people go to restaurants.
47$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$A lot of wallets.
48$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Pretty smart, huh?
49$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Pretty smart. I'm ready, let's go, right here, right now.
50$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$Remember, same as before, you're crowd control, I handle the employees.
51$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$Got it.
52$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG WOMAN$I love you, Pumpkin.
53$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOUNG MAN$I love you, Honey Bunny.
54$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Everybody be cool this is a robbery!
55$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$HONEY BUNNY$Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?
56$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$– Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?
57$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$What so you want to know?
58$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Well, hash is legal there, right?
59$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
60$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Those are hash bars?
61$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
62$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin', that's all there is to it.
63$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$You'll dig it the most. But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
64$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$What?
65$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$It's the little differences. A lotta the same shit we got here, they got there, but there they're a little different.
66$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Examples?
67$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a movie theatre. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald's. Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
68$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
69$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$No, they got the metric system there, they wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.
70$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$What'd they call it?
71$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Royale with Cheese.
72$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac?
73$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
74$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?
75$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
76$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$What?
77$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Mayonnaise.
78$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Goddamn!
79$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$VINCENT$I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it.
80$INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING$JULES$Uuccch!
81$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$JULES$We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
82$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$VINCENT$How many up there?
83$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$JULES$Three or four.
84$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$VINCENT$Counting our guy?
85$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$JULES$I'm not sure.
86$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$VINCENT$So there could be five guys up there?
87$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$JULES$It's possible.
88$INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING$VINCENT$We should have fuckin' shotguns.
89$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$What's her name?
90$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$JULES$Mia.
91$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$How did Marsellus and her meet?

93$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$She ever do anything I woulda saw?
94$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$JULES$I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
95$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$What's a pilot?
96$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$JULES$Well, you know the shows on TV?
97$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$I don't watch TV.
98$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$JULES$Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?
99$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$VINCENT$Yeah.
100$EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING$JULES$Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
101$INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING$JULES$You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.
102$INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING$VINCENT$Yeah maybe, fat right?
103$INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING$JULES$I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem.  What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan.
104$INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING$VINCENT$I think I know who you mean, what about him?
105$INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING$JULES$Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.  And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
106$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$What'd he do, fuck her?
107$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$JULES$No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad.
108$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$Well what then?
109$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$JULES$He gave her a foot massage.
110$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$A foot massage?
111$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$That's all?
112$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$What did Marsellus do?
113$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$JULES$Sent a couple of guys over to his place.  They took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom, enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses – nigger fell through that. Since then, he's kinda developed a speech impediment.
114$INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING$VINCENT$That's a damn shame.
115$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.
116$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Whaddya mean?
117$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
118$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$You don't think he overreacted?
119$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Antwan probably didn't expect Marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
120$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$It was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.
121$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$It's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace's new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out – no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.
122$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.
123$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Not the same thing, the same ballpark.
124$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$It ain't no ballpark either. Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. Foot massages don't mean shit.
125$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Have you ever given a foot massage?
126$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Don't be tellin' me about foot massages – I'm the foot fuckin' master.

132$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Fuck you.
133$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Would you give me a foot massage – I'm kinda tired.
134$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' pissed – this is the door.
135$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$What time is it?
136$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Seven-twenty-two in the morning.
137$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$It ain't quite time, let's hang back.
138$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.
139$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.
140$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$That's an interesting point, but let's get into character.
141$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$What's her name again?
142$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Mia. Why you so interested in big man's wife?
143$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.
144$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$Take care of her?
145$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$Not that! Take her out. Show her a good time. Don't let her get lonely.
146$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$JULES$You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
147$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$It ain't a date. It's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. It's just... you know... good company.
148$INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING$VINCENT$It's not a date.
149$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$Hey kids.

174$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$VINCENT$I ain't hungry.
175$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$Well, if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime. Me, I can't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
176$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$BRETT$No.
177$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$Tell 'em, Vincent.

179$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it that?
180$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$BRETT$Because of the metric system?
181$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$Check out the big brain on Brett. You'a smart motherfucker, that's right. The metric system. What's in this?

223$INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING$JULES$There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."

254$INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT$JODY$Forget that gun. That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril.

328$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.
329$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$That was my fifteen minutes.
330$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$What was it?
331$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
332$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$What?
333$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me.  We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...
334$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$What was your specialty?
335$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist – when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.
336$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Do you remember any of the jokes?
337$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show.
338$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Tell me.
339$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$No. It's really corny.
340$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$C'mon, don't be that way.
341$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed.
342$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh.
343$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$That's what I'm afraid of.
344$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$That's not what I meant and you know it.
345$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you?
346$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.
347$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much.
348$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$What a gyp.
349$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Yummy!
350$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
351$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Be my guest.
352$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$You can use my straw, I don't have kooties.
353$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Yeah, but maybe I do.
354$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Kooties I can handle.
355$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake.
356$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Told ya.
357$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$I don't know if it's worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
358$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Don't you hate that?
359$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$What?
360$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
361$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$I don't know.
362$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$That's when you know you found somebody special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.
363$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$I don't think we're there yet. But don't feel bad, we just met each other.
364$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$MIA$Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something to say.
365$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT$VINCENT$I'll do that.
366$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT$MIA$I said goddamn!
367$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Don't you love it when you go to the bathroom and you come back to find your food waiting for you?
368$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly doesn't seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
369$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Which one, there's two Marilyn Monroes.
370$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$No there's not.
371$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$That's Marilyn Monroe...
372$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.
373$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Pretty smart.
374$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$I have moments.
375$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Did ya think of something to say?
376$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Actually, there's something I've wanted to ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn't want to offend you.
377$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.
378$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Only if you promise not to get offended.
379$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
380$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Then let's just forget it.
381$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$That is an impossibility. Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
382$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Is that a fact?
383$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Besides, it's more exciting when you don't have permission.
384$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$What do you think about what happened to Antwan?
385$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Who's Antwan?
386$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Tony Rocky Horror.
387$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$He fell out of a window.
388$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$That's one way to say it. Another way is, he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
389$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Is that a fact?
390$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$No it's not, it's just what I heard.
391$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Who told you this?
392$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$They.
393$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$They talk a lot, don't they?
394$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$They certainly do.
395$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Well don't by shy Vincent, what exactly did they say?
396$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word?
397$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage.
398$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$And...?
399$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$No and, that's it.
400$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet?
401$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$Yeah.
402$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$And you believed that?
403$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable.
404$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
405$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
406$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
407$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$VINCENT$But did it happen?
408$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$MIA$The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again.  The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
409$INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT$ED SULLIVAN$Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

430$INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT$VINCENT$One drink and leave. Don't be rude, but drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your car, and go down the road.
431$INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT$VINCENT$...It's a moral test of yourself, whether or not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each other, that's very meaningful.

512$INT. SPARE ROOM$LANCE$Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.

529$EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT$VINCENT$Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.
530$EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT$MIA$Don't worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard of this, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
531$EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT$VINCENT$I seriously doubt that.

542$BUTCH'S POV$WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)$Butch.
543$BUTCH'S POV$MOTHER$Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W. camp?
544$BUTCH'S POV$BUTCH (O.S.)$Uh-huh.
545$BUTCH'S POV$MOTHER$Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.
546$BUTCH'S POV$CAPT. KOONS$Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy's. We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together.  Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it, Major Coolidge would be talkin' right now to my son Jim. But the way it worked out is I'm talkin' to you, Butch. I got somethin' for ya.
547$BUTCH'S POV$CAPT. KOONS$This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great-granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.
548$INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT$KLONDIKE$It's time, Butch.
549$INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT$BUTCH$I'm ready.
550$INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT$SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)$– Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen.
551$EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT$SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)$...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead?
552$EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT$SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)$My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing. I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
553$INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT$SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)$Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing?
554$INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT$SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)$Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

563$INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT$MARSELLUS (O.S.)$I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.

565$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Hey, how do I open the window back here?
566$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$ESMARELDA$I have to do it.

581$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$ESMARELDA$No, it's a subject I have much interest in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So, what was it like to kill a man?
582$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Tell ya what, you give me one of them cigarettes, I'll give you an answer.

595$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead. Now I know he's dead, do you wanna know how I feel about it?
596$INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$I don't feel the least little bit bad.
597$EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$What'd I tell ya, soon as the word got out a fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better fighter he's be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first place, which he never shoulda done, he'd be alive. Enough about the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you spread it around with?
598$EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Fabienne my love, our adventure begins.
599$EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT$ESMARELDA$Forty-five sixty.

601$EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Now if anybody should ask you about who your fare was tonight, what're you gonna tell 'em?
602$EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT$ESMARELDA$The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly toasted, Mexicans.
603$EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Bon soir, Esmarelda.
604$EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT$ESMARELDA$Sleep well, Butch.
605$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$Keep the light off.
606$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Is that better, sugar pop?
607$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$Oui. Hard day at the office?
608$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Pretty hard. I got into a fight.
609$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$Poor baby. Can we make spoons?
610$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$I was looking at myself in the mirror.
611$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Uh-huh?
612$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$I wish I had a pot.
613$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$You were lookin' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
614$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are sexy.
615$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.
616$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "Lucky Star," it's not the same thing.
617$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$I didn't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly.
618$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$The difference is huge.
619$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$You want me to have a pot?
620$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$FABIENNE$No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.

744$INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT$BUTCH$That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.

906$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$JULES$Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what.
907$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$VINCENT$Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
908$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$JULES$Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor.
909$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$VINCENT$If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.
910$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$JULES$What the fuck did you just do to his towel?
911$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$VINCENT$I was just dryin' my hands.

914$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$JULES$I watched you get 'em wet.
915$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$VINCENT$I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.
916$INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY$JULES$I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position.

921$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.
922$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JULES$Jimmie –
923$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

927$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JULES$Why?
928$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business!
929$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$– I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation – fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do.

930$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JULES$Jimmie –
931$INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife.

935$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JULES$You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do.
936$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$MARSELLUS$I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs."
937$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JULES$I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna hear from your ass is: "you ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin' directly."
938$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$MARSELLUS$You ain't got no problems, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf, who should be comin' directly.

951$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$THE WOLF$You must be Jules, which would make you Vincent. Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?
952$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$JIMMIE$100%.
953$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Your wife, Bonnie... ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is that correct?
954$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$JIMMIE$Uh-huh.
955$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$THE WOLF$I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it none too much.
956$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$JIMMIE$She won't at that.
957$INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING$THE WOLF$That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.
958$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Jimmie?
959$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$JIMMIE$Yes.
960$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?
961$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$JIMMIE$Sure, how do you take it?
962$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
963$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is there gas in it, anything?
964$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$JULES$Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
965$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Positive?  Don't get me out on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
966$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$JULES$Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
967$INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING$THE WOLF$Good enough, let's go back to the kitchen.
968$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$Thank you, Jimmie.
969$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$Okay first thing, you two. Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?
970$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$JIMMIE$Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
971$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe down the upholstery – now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.  But the windows are a different story.  Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.  Jimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.
972$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$VINCENT$A "please" would be nice.
973$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$Come again?
974$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$VINCENT$I said a "please" would be nice.
975$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please."I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen.
976$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$JULES$It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated.
977$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$VINCENT$I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
978$INT. KITCHEN – MORNING$THE WOLF$If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
979$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$THE WOLF$It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin', except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who'll be missed. You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. How we comin', Jimmie?
980$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JIMMIE$Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin' –

982$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JIMMIE$You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore –
983$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$THE WOLF$– let me ask you a question, if you don't mind?
984$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JIMMIE$Sure.
985$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$THE WOLF$Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires?
986$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JIMMIE$No.
987$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$THE WOLF$Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?
988$INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING$JIMMIE$Oak's nice.
989$INT. GARAGE – MORNING$JULES$I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!
990$INT. GARAGE – MORNING$VINCENT$Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings?
991$INT. GARAGE – MORNING$JULES$Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.
992$INT. GARAGE – MORNING$VINCENT$I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow.
993$INT. GARAGE – MORNING$JULES$You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull.
994$INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING$THE WOLF$Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet.
995$INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING$JIMMIE$I can't believe that's the same car.
996$INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING$THE WOLF$Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two.

1044$EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING$JULES$Wanna share a cab?
1045$EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING$VINCENT$You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me?
1046$EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING$JULES$Sure.
1047$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?
1048$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Naw, I don't eat pork.
1049$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Are you Jewish?
1050$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine.
1051$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Why not?
1052$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.
1053$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good.
1054$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.
1055$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces.
1056$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$I don't eat dog either.
1057$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
1058$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.
1059$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?
1060$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.
1061$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet.
1062$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$I just been sittin' here thinkin'.
1063$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$About what?
1064$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$The miracle we witnessed.
1065$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.
1066$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Do you know that a miracle is?
1067$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$An act of God.
1068$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$What's an act of God?
1069$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies.
1070$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
1071$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$But why?
1072$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep.
1073$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$So you're serious, you're really gonna quit?
1074$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$The life, most definitely.
1075$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PATRON$Garcon! Coffee!
1076$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$So if you're quitting the life, what'll you do?
1077$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$That's what I've been sitting here contemplating. First, I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.
1078$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$What do you mean, walk the earth?
1079$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." Just walk from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.
1080$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$How long do you intend to walk the earth?
1081$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Until God puts me where he want me to be.
1082$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$What if he never does?
1083$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$If it takes forever, I'll wait forever.
1084$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$So you decided to be a bum?
1085$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no more, no less.
1086$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums. And without a job, residence, or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be – a fuckin' bum!
1087$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Look my friend, this is just where me and you differ –
1088$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$– what happened was peculiar – no doubt about it – but it wasn't water into wine.
1089$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$All shapes and sizes, Vince.
1090$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!
1091$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$If you find my answers frightening, Vincent, you should cease askin' scary questions.
1092$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$I gotta take a shit. To be continued.
1093$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!
1094$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$HONEY BUNNY$Any of you fuckin' pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!  Got that?!
1095$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Customers stay seated, waitresses on the floor.
1096$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$HONEY BUNNY$Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, do it or fucking die!

1104$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$HONEY BUNNY$Don't take any chances. Execute him!
1105$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$MANAGER$Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm just a coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.
1106$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll be all over.
1107$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$MANAGER$Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all over soon!
1108$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Well done, now git your fuckin' ass on the ground.
1109$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
1110$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$In the bag.
1111$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$What's in that?
1112$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$My boss' dirty laundry.
1113$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$You boss makes you do his laundry?
1114$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$When he wants it clean.
1115$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Sounds like a shit job.
1116$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing.
1117$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Open it up.
1118$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$'Fraid I can't do that.

1146$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Just chill out.
1147$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$What's her name?
1148$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Yolanda.
1149$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?
1150$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOLANDA$Don't you hurt him.
1151$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're gonna be like three Fonzies. And what' Fonzie like?

1156$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOLANDA$Okay, now let him go!
1157$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.  When you yell at me, it makes me nervous.  When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.
1158$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOLANDA$Just know: you hurt him, you die.
1159$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$That seems to be the situation. Now I don't want that and you don't want that and Ringo here don't want that. So let's see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.
1160$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT (O.S.)$What the fuck's goin' on here?
1161$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. We're still just talkin'. Tell her we're still cool.
1162$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still cool.
1163$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$What the hell's goin' on, Jules?
1164$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Nothin' I can't handle. I want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.
1165$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Check.
1166$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Yolanda, how we doin, baby?
1167$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$YOLANDA$I gotta go pee! I want to go home.
1168$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, Ringo's proud of you and so am I.  It's almost over. Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
1169$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Which one is it?
1170$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$It's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it.
1171$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$That's my bad motherfucker. Now open it up and take out the cash. How much is there?
1172$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$About fifteen hundred dollars.
1173$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Put it in your pocket, it's yours. Now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.
1174$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.
1175$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?
1176$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$What?
1177$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?
1178$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$PUMPKIN$Not regularly.
1179$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years.  And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.  I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
1180$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$It's cold.
1181$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$VINCENT$I think we oughta leave now.
1182$INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING$JULES$That's probably a good idea.
