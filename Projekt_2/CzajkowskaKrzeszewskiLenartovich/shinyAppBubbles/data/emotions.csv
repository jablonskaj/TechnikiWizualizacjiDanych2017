They feel that the apartment has become a mousetrap - and they're not wrong. LEON breaks a small tile to make a hole in the kitchen wall. He puts his eye to the hole.

MATHILDA approaches the police blanket on the ground. She bends down and lifts the edge of it. LEON is a bloody mess but his expression is peaceful. She caresses his cheek. The AGENT taps STANSFIELD on the back. The group turns around and sees the girl at the foot of the corpse. MATHILDA kisses LEON on the mouth and covers him up. She leaves her gun on the ground. She looks STANSFIELD straight in the eyes with a huge smile. STANSFIELD doesn't understand. MATHILDA takes her hand out of her pocket and throws something to him. STANSFIELD catches the flying object. It's a grenade ring. STANSFIELD still doesn't understand. MATHILDA opens the two sides of LEON's bag: inside there are a dozen grenades. The grenade with the missing pin is in the bag. Now STANSFIELD understands. Suddenly there's a tremendous explosion. The flames blow down the hallway into the street.
